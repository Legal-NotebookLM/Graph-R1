## 3. BORROWER'S RESPONSE

**Email dated:** 28th November 2024

Dear Sir,

I acknowledge my loan obligation. The bike was my only means of livelihood (delivery work). After theft, I lost my income completely.

**My Situation:**
- Bike not insured (my mistake)
- FIR filed but police says recovery unlikely
- Now doing odd jobs earning ₹8,000-10,000/month
- Willing to pay but cannot afford ₹3,442 EMI

**Proposal:**
- EMI reduction to ₹1,500 for 12 months
- Then resume ₹3,442 EMI when I get stable job

I request compassionate consideration.

Regards,  
Sanjay Kumar
