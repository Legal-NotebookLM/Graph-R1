### FINDINGS AND REASONS

**Re: Issue No. 1 (Jurisdiction)**

17. The Loan Agreement dated 15th March 2023 contains an arbitration clause at Clause 18 which clearly provides for resolution of disputes through arbitration.

18. The arbitration clause is valid, binding, and in accordance with Section 7 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.

19. The present dispute pertains to non-payment of loan EMIs and recovery of outstanding dues, which directly arises out of the Loan Agreement.

20. The Claimant has followed due procedure by issuing a Section 21 Notice on 28th March 2024.

21. This Tribunal was duly appointed by the competent court under Section 11 of the Act vide order dated 1st June 2024.

22. **FINDING:** This Tribunal has complete jurisdiction to adjudicate the present dispute.

**Re: Issue No. 2 (Breach of Contract)**

23. The Loan Agreement is an admitted document. The Respondent has neither disputed the execution of the agreement nor the receipt of loan amount.

24. The loan amount of ₹85,000/- was admittedly disbursed to the Respondent on 22nd March 2023 as evidenced by the Disbursal Memo.

25. The Respondent was under a contractual obligation to repay the loan in 36 monthly installments of ₹3,042/- each as per the Repayment Schedule.

26. The bank statements placed on record clearly show that:
    - EMIs were paid regularly from April 2023 to October 2023
    - EMI bounced in November 2023 due to insufficient funds
    - Only partial payment of ₹1,500/- was made in December 2023
    - No payment has been made from January 2024 onwards

27. The Claimant has established through documentary evidence that repeated reminders, notices, and field visits were made, but the Respondent deliberately avoided payment.

28. The Loan Recall Notice dated 5th March 2024 was duly served upon the Respondent, calling upon him to clear all dues within 15 days.

29. The Respondent has neither responded to any notice nor participated in these arbitration proceedings.

30. **FINDING:** The Respondent has committed willful and deliberate breach of the Loan Agreement by defaulting in payment of EMIs from November 2023 onwards.

**Re: Issue No. 3 (Entitlement to Reliefs)**

31. Having found that the Respondent has breached the Loan Agreement, the next question is whether the Claimant is entitled to the monetary relief claimed.

32. The Statement of Account filed by the Claimant shows the following:

| Particulars | Amount (₹) |
|-------------|-----------|
| Principal Disbursed | 85,000.00 |
| Principal Recovered | 18,362.00 |

33. I have carefully examined the Statement of Account. The calculations are mathematically correct and in accordance with the terms of the Loan Agreement.

34. The interest rate of 16.5% p.a. is as per the agreed terms in the Loan Agreement.

35. The penal interest of 3% per month on overdue amounts is also stipulated in Clause 7 of the Loan Agreement and is enforceable.

36. The legal notice charges of ₹5,000/- are reasonable and justified considering the efforts made by the Claimant in recovery.

37. **FINDING:** The Claimant is entitled to recover ₹1,02,935/- from the Respondent along with future interest @ 16.5% p.a. from 15th November 2024 till the date of actual payment/realization.

**Re: Issue No. 4 (Costs)**

38. The Claimant has been compelled to invoke arbitration due to the Respondent's deliberate default and non-cooperation.

41. **FINDING:** The Respondent shall bear the entire costs of arbitration including arbitrator's fees and advocate's fees.
