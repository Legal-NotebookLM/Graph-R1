    "golden_answers": [
      "The case file does not clearly mention the vehicle registration number for the Honda CB Shine financed under this loan. This is an important omission for a two-wheeler loan case where vehicle attachment may be needed if restructuring fails. The registration details should be verified and added to the case file."
