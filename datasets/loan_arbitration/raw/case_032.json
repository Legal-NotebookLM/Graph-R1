    "golden_answers": [
      "The ₹40,000 settlement (55% of ₹72,538) should be evaluated considering: (1) Borrower's current village income (₹8,000/month) is severely reduced, (2) Borrower is cooperative and has made partial payments, (3) Vehicle value may be ₹30,000-40,000, (4) Full recovery through litigation may cost more than settlement.

    "golden_answers": [
      "The 67% income reduction (₹24,000 to ₹8,000) severely impacts recovery capacity. At ₹8,000/month, the borrower can afford only ₹500-1,000/month for debt service, making full recovery unrealistic.

      "Yes, the partial payment demonstrates: (1) Acknowledgment of debt, (2) Good faith effort despite reduced capacity, (3) Desire to continue payment, (4) Some payment capacity exists.

      "From ₹12,684 payments, ₹11,146 (87.9%) went to principal and ₹1,538 (12.1%) to interest. For a 17.5% loan, early EMIs typically have 75-80% principal component.

    "golden_answers": [
      "Yes, if settlement is reached through consent award, costs should be reduced: (1) Lower advocate time (no full litigation), (2) Shorter proceedings, (3) Goodwill gesture, (4) Facilitates agreement. Typical consent award costs: ₹25,000-35,000 versus ₹50,000+ for contested. Cost reduction incentivizes settlement."

    "golden_answers": [
      "Effective recovery: ₹40,000 settlement from ₹72,538 outstanding = 55% recovery. However, if vehicle (worth ~₹35,000) is surrendered, total recovery is ~₹75,000 (103% of outstanding). The settlement should specify whether vehicle is included or additional. Net recovery after costs depends on execution expenses saved through settlement."

    "golden_answers": [
      "Earlier restructuring might have prevented default: (1) When borrower first mentioned app issues (July 2024), (2) Before relocation occurred, (3) When partial payment was made (August). However, restructuring requires borrower engagement, which may not have been sought earlier. The current settlement discussions are the appropriate response now."

    "golden_answers": [
      "For a gig worker earning ₹24,000/month, a ₹58,000 loan with ₹2,871 EMI (12% of income) was appropriately sized. However, gig work income volatility wasn't adequately accounted for. The loan assumed stable income, but gig economy fluctuations caused the default. Future underwriting should factor income variability for gig workers."

    "golden_answers": [
      "E-commerce competition may affect: (1) Delivery order volumes (fewer orders = less income), (2) Platform incentives (reduced bonuses), (3) Rider competition (more riders = fewer orders per rider). For a Swiggy delivery partner, reduced orders directly impact income. This explains the income decline from ₹24,000 to current ₹8,000."

Given ₹8,000/month income, installments of ₹5,000-6,000/month over 7-8 months may be more realistic than lump sum."

      "Yes, the detailed response should be treated as mitigating circumstances: (1) Explains genuine hardship (relocation, income reduction), (2) Shows cooperation rather than evasion, (3) Proposes realistic settlement, (4) Demonstrates good faith.

      "If settlement is accepted: (1) Case should be kept open until payment is received, (2) Monitor payment schedule if installments, (3) Close only after full payment, (4) Maintain records for future reference.

      "Yes, if settlement is agreed, it should be formalized in a consent award: (1) Legally binding and enforceable, (2) Provides court backing for payment, (3) Enables execution if payment defaults, (4) Closes the arbitration formally.

      "Vehicle utility in village: (1) May be used for local transport, (2) Less essential than city delivery work, (3) Potentially sellable for ₹30,000-40,000.

      "Counter-proposal strategy: (1) Accept ₹40,000 if vehicle is surrendered (total ~₹75,000), (2) Counter with ₹45,000-50,000 if vehicle retained, (3) Consider execution costs saved.

      "Yes, business closure risk should accelerate settlement: (1) If shop closes, income drops further, (2) Settlement capacity reduces, (3) Vehicle may be sold for living expenses, (4) Recovery becomes harder. Early settlement before business closure protects recovery. The lender should expedite discussions and offer reasonable terms to close quickly."

      "Appropriate response timeline: (1) Acknowledge receipt within 3-5 days, (2) Internal evaluation and decision within 1-2 weeks, (3) Counter-proposal or acceptance within 2-3 weeks of receipt.

      "Arbitration should continue in parallel but at reduced pace: (1) Maintains legal pressure and timeline, (2) Provides backup if settlement fails, (3) Doesn't preclude settlement, (4) Can be paused if settlement progresses.

      "Write-off consideration: (1) Current income ₹8,000/month makes full recovery unrealistic, (2) Execution costs may exceed recoverable amounts, (3) Vehicle value (~₹35,000) provides some recovery, (4) Settlement at 55% is better than write-off. If settlement fails, execution for vehicle may yield ₹30,000-35,000 net, which is still better than write-off. Write-off should be last resort."

      "Optimal settlement: (1) Vehicle surrender (worth ~₹35,000) + ₹5,000-10,000 cash = ₹40,000-45,000 total, (2) Or ₹40,000 in installments (₹5,000-6,000/month) if vehicle retained, (3) Payment completion within 6-8 months, (4) Consent award formalizing terms.
