      "golden_answers": [
        "This wording is insufficient because Section 21 requires a direct reference to the arbitration clause and a clear communication that arbitration is being invoked. The current phrase is ambiguous and should be replaced with a properly drafted notice referencing Clause 18 of the 15 March 2023 loan agreement."

      "golden_answers": [
        "The notice conveys default but omits key factual detail regarding overdue EMIs, which weakens its clarity. Including the EMI breakdown, particularly the November 2023 bounce and subsequent unpaid months, would make the demand more defensible."

      "golden_answers": [

      "golden_answers": [
        "Immediate possession is granted only when there is compelling evidence of imminent disposal. Given the borrower's relocation and evasion since January 2024, a preservation-focused prayer is more appropriate unless evidence of an attempted sale is included."

      "question": "The SOC narrates that the borrower 'abandoned communication entirely in 2024', but part payment was received in December 2023. Does the phrasing require refinement?",
      "golden_answers": [
