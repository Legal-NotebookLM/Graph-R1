      "There is slight risk that continued communication may be seen as indicating willingness to negotiate rather than necessity for arbitration.

      "There's no statutory priority order; the decree holder can choose execution methods based on practicality and cost-effectiveness.

      "Yes, business closure risk increases settlement urgency: (1) If shop closes, income drops to zero, (2) Settlement capacity further reduced, (3) Vehicle may be sold to meet living expenses, (4) Recovery becomes more difficult.

The borrower's consistent narrative, actual relocation, and current low income provide sufficient evidence. Focus should be on current capacity and settlement rather than historical verification."

The ₹35,000 fee for an ~₹80,000 claim is actually conservative, likely reflecting: (1) Ex-parte proceedings being simpler, (2) Compassionate reduction given borrower's circumstances, or (3) Lower rates for rural seat cases.

      "Net salary is appropriate for attachment calculations: (1) Gross salary includes statutory deductions (PF, TDS) the employee never receives, (2) Net/take-home reflects actual disposable income, (3) Court orders typically specify net salary to ensure reasonable living standard. 20-25% of ₹40,800 net would be ₹8,160-10,200/month, covering the EMI with some buffer."

      "Mental health is sensitive, and requesting fitness certificates could be intrusive. For loan enforcement, the borrower's legal capacity is presumed unless declared incompetent by a court.

      "A concrete arrangement would be a written agreement signed by the borrower specifying: exact EMI amount, payment dates, duration, consequences of non-compliance, and any upfront payment.
