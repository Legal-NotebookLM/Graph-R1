      "Yes, documenting broken promises demonstrates a pattern of non-compliance and strengthens the lender's case that the borrower, despite opportunities, failed to honor commitments.

      "Waiving or reducing legal charges in settlement is a goodwill gesture that often facilitates agreement.

    "golden_answers": [
      "Verification of village shop employment is challenging: (1) Small shops may not have formal employment records, (2) Income may be variable, (3) Verification costs may exceed benefit.
