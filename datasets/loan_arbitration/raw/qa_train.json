      "Focus should shift to workplace for communication and salary attachment as primary recovery mode. The residence is no longer a viable service point.

      "Obtaining agricultural data would strengthen the lender's due diligence and provide context for settlement discussions. If crop failure is documented, it supports flexible recovery terms.
