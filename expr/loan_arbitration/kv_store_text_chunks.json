    "content": "### **Section 1 – The Foundation Stone**\n\n**What it means:**\nThis section gives the Act its official name, defines where it applies (all of India), and sets the date when it came into force (22nd August, 1996). Parts I, III, and IV apply to Jammu \\& Kashmir only for international commercial matters.[^1_1][^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nYour arbitration clauses in loan agreements are governed by this Act throughout India. If you operate in J\\&K, ensure your arbitration clauses clearly specify whether the dispute is domestic or international commercial.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nYou're protected by this law anywhere in India when your loan agreement has an arbitration clause. The same rules apply whether you're in Mumbai, Delhi, or any other state.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nRavi takes a ₹5 lakh personal loan from QuickCash NBFC in Srinagar. The loan agreement contains an arbitration clause. When a dispute arises over interest calculation, Ravi can invoke arbitration under this Act, but since it's a domestic matter (not international commercial), the full provisions of Part I apply.\n\n***\n\n## **PART I – ARBITRATION**\n\n### **CHAPTER I – GENERAL PROVISIONS**\n\n### **Section 2 – The Dictionary of Disputes**\n\n**What it means:**\nThis is the definitions section. It explains key terms like \"arbitration,\" \"arbitration agreement,\" \"arbitral tribunal,\" \"Court,\" and \"international commercial arbitration.\" Critically, it defines which court has jurisdiction – for domestic arbitration, it's the principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction; for international commercial arbitration, it's the High Court.[^1_3][^1_2][^1_1]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nYou must understand which court has jurisdiction based on your dispute type. Domestic loan disputes go to district civil courts, while international commercial disputes go to High Court. This impacts your legal strategy and costs.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nIf you challenge an arbitration award, you need to know which court to approach. For regular personal or business loans, it's your local civil court, not the High Court – making it more accessible.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nMicroFin Ltd lends ₹10 lakhs to Sharma Enterprises. When EMI defaults occur, MicroFin initiates arbitration. Sharma wants to challenge the award – under Section 2(1)(e)(i), he must approach the Principal Civil Court (District Court) with original jurisdiction in his district, not the High Court, making legal recourse more affordable.\n\n***\n\n### **Section 3 – When Did You Actually Get My Notice?**\n\n**What it means:**\nThis section establishes when written communications are deemed \"received.\" A notice is considered received when delivered personally, at business address, residence, or mailing address. If none can be found after reasonable inquiry, sending to the last known address by registered post counts as delivery.[^1_2][^1_1]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nYour legal notices, arbitration invitations, and demand letters are deemed delivered when sent by registered post to the borrower's last known address. Maintain proof of dispatch – you don't need proof of actual receipt.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nAlways update your address with your lender. If you've moved and didn't inform them, arbitration proceedings can start without you knowing, based on notices sent to your old address.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nCreditLine NBFC sends an arbitration notice to borrower Meena at her address mentioned in the loan agreement. Meena has shifted to a new city but never updated her address. The notice is deemed received the day it's sent by registered post to her old address. When Meena later claims she never received it, the court upholds the arbitration proceeding because Section 3 was followed.\n\n***\n\n### **Section 4 – Silence Means Agreement (The Waiver Trap)**\n\n**What it means:**\nIf you know that any provision of the Act or arbitration agreement hasn't been followed properly, but you continue with the arbitration without objecting immediately (or within the time limit specified), you lose your right to object later.[^1_1][^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nIf a borrower participates in arbitration without objecting to procedural irregularities (like improper arbitrator appointment), they cannot later challenge the award on those grounds. This protects your arbitration awards from delayed challenges.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\n**Critical warning:** If you notice any irregularity – like the lender appointing an arbitrator unilaterally when the agreement required mutual selection, or arbitration proceedings in the wrong city – object immediately in writing. Silence equals consent.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nFastLoan Finance appoints their panel arbitrator unilaterally, though the loan agreement stated both parties should mutually select the arbitrator. Borrower Rajesh attends two arbitration hearings, presents his defense, but never objects to the arbitrator's appointment. Later, when the award goes against him, Rajesh cannot challenge it on grounds of improper appointment – Section 4 has waived his right to object.\n\n***\n\n### **Section 5 – The Court's Hands Are Tied**\n\n**What it means:**\nCourts cannot intervene in arbitration matters except where explicitly allowed by this Act. This is the \"minimal judicial intervention\" principle – arbitration is meant to be independent from courts.[^1_4][^1_2][^1_1]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nOnce arbitration starts, courts generally won't interfere. This gives you faster dispute resolution without borrowers running to court at every stage. However, you can approach courts only for specific matters listed in the Act (like appointing arbitrators or interim relief).\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nYou cannot simply go to court",

    "content": "intervention\" principle – arbitration is meant to be independent from courts.[^1_4][^1_2][^1_1]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nOnce arbitration starts, courts generally won't interfere. This gives you faster dispute resolution without borrowers running to court at every stage. However, you can approach courts only for specific matters listed in the Act (like appointing arbitrators or interim relief).\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nYou cannot simply go to court to stop or interfere with arbitration. Courts will only help in specific situations defined by the Act – like if you need urgent protection of your property or if the arbitrator is biased.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nCapitalFirst NBFC initiates arbitration against borrower Dinesh for ₹8 lakh outstanding. Dinesh, unhappy with the arbitration proceedings, files a civil suit seeking to stop the arbitration and declare the loan agreement void. The civil court refuses to entertain his suit, citing Section 5 – courts cannot intervene unless specific grounds under the Act are shown. Dinesh must either participate in arbitration or challenge it on limited grounds like invalidity of the arbitration agreement itself.\n\n***\n\n### **Section 6 – Getting Administrative Help**\n\n**What it means:**\nParties or the arbitral tribunal (with parties' consent) can arrange for administrative assistance from any suitable institution or person to help conduct the arbitration proceedings smoothly.[^1_2][^1_1]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nYou can engage arbitration institutions (like MCIA, DIAC, ICC) to provide administrative support – scheduling hearings, maintaining records, providing venues. This makes the process more professional and organized.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nThis ensures arbitration isn't just a private affair controlled by the lender. Institutional support brings structure, neutrality, and professionalism, protecting your interests.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nMoneyTree Finance and borrower Kavita agree to arbitration for a ₹15 lakh loan dispute. Instead of handling logistics themselves, they jointly appoint the Mumbai Centre for International Arbitration (MCIA) to provide administrative support under Section 6. MCIA schedules hearings, manages document exchange, provides hearing rooms, and maintains case records, making the process smoother and more transparent for both parties.\n\n***\n\n### **CHAPTER II – ARBITRATION AGREEMENT**\n\n### **Section 7 – The Gateway to Arbitration**\n\n**What it means:**\nThis section defines what constitutes a valid arbitration agreement. It must be in writing (signed document, exchange of letters/emails, or even in statements of claim/defense where one party alleges its existence and the other doesn't deny it). The agreement can be a separate document or a clause within the main contract.[^1_5][^1_4][^1_1][^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nYour arbitration clause in loan agreements must be in writing. Electronic communications (emails, SMS) containing arbitration agreement are valid. Ensure borrowers sign the loan agreement containing the arbitration clause, or maintain electronic records of acceptance.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nIf your loan agreement contains an arbitration clause (even buried in fine print), and you've signed it, you're bound by it. Even exchange of emails can create a binding arbitration agreement. Read before you sign!\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nSwiftCredit sends Priya a loan offer via email stating: \"Any disputes will be resolved through arbitration in Mumbai.\" Priya replies via email: \"Agreed, please disburse the loan.\" This exchange constitutes a valid written arbitration agreement under Section 7, even without a formal signed document. When a dispute arises, Priya cannot refuse arbitration claiming there was no written agreement – the email exchange is sufficient.\n\n***\n\n### **Section 8 – The Court Must Step Aside**\n\n**What it means:**\nIf a party files a court case on a matter covered by an arbitration agreement, the other party can apply (before filing their first statement on substance) to have the matter referred to arbitration. The court must refer the parties to arbitration unless it finds prima facie that no valid arbitration agreement exists.[^1_6][^1_7][^1_4][^1_1][^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nIf a borrower files a civil suit against you despite the arbitration clause in the loan agreement, you can invoke Section 8 to have the matter referred to arbitration. File this application before submitting your written statement on merits. This prevents borrowers from bypassing arbitration.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nIf you file a court case challenging the loan or its terms, the lender can force you back to arbitration if there's a valid arbitration clause. You must file your Section 8 application before the lender files their first defense statement – timing is critical.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nAnil defaults on his ₹20 lakh home loan from HousingFin Ltd. Instead of arbitration (as per the loan agreement), Anil files a civil suit claiming usurious interest rates. HousingFin immediately files a Section 8 application with the original arbitration agreement attached, requesting the court to refer parties to arbitration. The court examines the arbitration clause, finds it valid, and directs both parties to proceed to arbitration, dismissing Anil's suit.[^1_7][^1_8]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 9 – Emergency Protection from Courts**\n\n**What it means:**\nBefore, during, or even after arbitration (but before award enforcement), parties can approach the court for urgent interim relief – like preventing sale of mortgaged property, freezing disputed amounts, appointing receivers, or getting interim injunctions. Once the arbitral tribunal is constituted, courts will only intervene if the tribunal's remedies are not sufficient.[^1_9][^1_4][^1_1][^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:",

Once the arbitral tribunal is constituted, courts will only intervene if the tribunal's remedies are not sufficient.[^1_9][^1_4][^1_1][^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nYou can approach court for urgent protection – like preventing borrower from selling mortgaged property or transferring assets. File Section 9 applications when you fear the borrower will dissipate assets before the arbitration award. However, once tribunal is constituted, you must first try getting relief from the tribunal itself.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nYou too can seek court protection – like stopping the lender from illegally repossessing your vehicle or home during arbitration. This is your emergency brake. But you must commence arbitration within 90 days of getting such interim relief, otherwise it lapses.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nVehicleLoan NBFC has an arbitration dispute with borrower Suresh over a ₹12 lakh car loan. Suresh defaults and the NBFC fears he will sell the car (which is security). Before starting arbitration, VehicleLoan files a Section 9 application in court seeking an interim injunction restraining Suresh from selling or transferring the vehicle. The court grants the injunction. VehicleLoan must now commence arbitration within 90 days, otherwise this interim protection will lapse.[^1_8][^1_1]\n\n***\n\n### **CHAPTER III – COMPOSITION OF ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL**\n\n### **Section 10 – How Many Judges for Your Case?**\n\n**What it means:**\nParties can decide how many arbitrators they want, but the number must be odd (1, 3, 5, etc., never 2, 4, or 6). If parties don't decide, there will be one sole arbitrator.[^1_1][^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nIn standard loan agreements, specify \"one sole arbitrator\" to keep costs low. For large disputes (above ₹50 lakhs), you might prefer three arbitrators for more thorough examination, but this increases costs significantly.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nIf the agreement says \"sole arbitrator,\" you'll have only one person deciding your fate. For larger disputes, you can negotiate for three arbitrators – you appoint one, lender appoints one, and those two appoint the third – giving you more balanced representation, though at higher cost.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nMegaFinance's standard loan agreement states: \"Disputes shall be resolved by a sole arbitrator.\" Borrower Deepak defaults on a ₹50 lakh business loan and wants three arbitrators for a more balanced hearing. However, he's bound by Section 10 and the contract – unless MegaFinance agrees, it will be a sole arbitrator. Had Deepak negotiated this before signing, he could have ensured three arbitrators for disputes above a certain threshold.\n\n***\n\n### **Section 11 – Who Will Be Your Judge? (The Appointment Battle)**\n\n**What it means:**\nParties are free to agree on how arbitrators are appointed. For three arbitrators, each party appoints one, and those two appoint the third (presiding arbitrator). For a sole arbitrator, parties must agree on the name. If parties can't agree, the Supreme Court/High Court (depending on dispute type) will appoint the arbitrator. The court must act within 60 days.[^1_10][^1_2][^1_1]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nMany NBFCs include clauses like \"The Managing Director of the Company shall appoint the sole arbitrator.\" This is problematic – courts have struck down such one-sided appointments as biased. Better approach: maintain a panel and let borrower have a say, or agree on institutional appointment.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\n**Critical protection:** If the loan agreement allows the lender to unilaterally appoint the arbitrator, you can challenge this in court under Section 11. Courts now require arbitrator appointment to be neutral. If you and lender can't agree on an arbitrator within 30 days, either of you can approach the High Court for appointment.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nSmartLoan's agreement states: \"The CEO of SmartLoan shall appoint a sole arbitrator.\" When borrower Ramesh defaults on ₹8 lakhs, SmartLoan's CEO appoints their panel arbitrator (who has decided 50 cases in favor of SmartLoan). Ramesh challenges this appointment under Section 11, approaching the High Court. The Court finds the appointment mechanism one-sided and appoints an independent arbitrator from the court's panel instead, ensuring neutrality.[^1_11][^1_12][^1_7]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 11A – Government Can Update Fee Structure**\n\n**What it means:**\nThe Central Government can amend the Fourth Schedule (which contains the fee structure for arbitrators) by notification, after laying the draft before Parliament.[^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nArbitrator fees are regulated by the Fourth Schedule rates (unless parties agree otherwise or it's international arbitration). Monitor changes to budget for arbitration costs accurately.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nThe fees that arbitrators can charge are capped by law (Fourth Schedule) for non-international disputes. If an arbitrator demands excessive fees, you can object citing the Schedule.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nIn a ₹25 lakh loan dispute between BorrowEasy Finance and entrepreneur Seema, the appointed arbitrator demands ₹5 lakhs as fees. Seema objects, citing the Fourth Schedule",

If an arbitrator demands excessive fees, you can object citing the Schedule.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nIn a ₹25 lakh loan dispute between BorrowEasy Finance and entrepreneur Seema, the appointed arbitrator demands ₹5 lakhs as fees. Seema objects, citing the Fourth Schedule which caps fees at ₹2.25 lakhs for claims between ₹20-50 lakhs (subject to judicial interpretation). The arbitrator must justify any excess or reduce the fee. This provision protects borrowers from cost-prohibitive arbitration.[^1_2]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 12 – Can This Judge Be Trusted? (Disclosure Requirements)**\n\n**What it means:**\nWhen approached for appointment, a potential arbitrator must disclose in writing: (a) any past/present relationship with parties that might raise doubts about independence/impartiality, and (b) whether they can devote sufficient time and complete arbitration within 12 months. Arbitrators can be challenged if there are justifiable doubts about their independence or if they lack agreed qualifications.[^1_13][^1_1][^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nThe arbitrator you propose must make full disclosures. If they've decided 100 cases for your company, this creates \"justifiable doubts\" about impartiality. Select genuinely independent arbitrators to avoid awards being set aside later. Institutional arbitration helps ensure neutrality.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\n**Your key protection:** Ask the proposed arbitrator about their past work with the lender. If they've repeatedly worked for the lender or have financial interests, challenge their appointment citing Section 12. The Fifth Schedule lists specific grounds (like financial interest in the dispute) that justify challenge.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nCreditMax proposes Advocate Singh as arbitrator for a dispute with borrower Pooja over ₹15 lakhs. Under Section 12, Singh must disclose that he has appeared as counsel for CreditMax in 15 cases over the past three years. Pooja objects, claiming justifiable doubts about independence. The court agrees – Section 12 read with Fifth Schedule (which lists \"past or present relationship with a party\") justifies the challenge. A new arbitrator is appointed.[^1_13]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 13 – Challenging a Biased Judge**\n\n**What it means:**\nParties can challenge an arbitrator if circumstances create justifiable doubts about independence/impartiality, or if the arbitrator lacks agreed qualifications. Challenge must be made within 15 days of becoming aware of grounds. The arbitral tribunal decides on the challenge. If challenge is rejected and arbitration continues, the challenging party can later seek to set aside the award under Section 34.[^1_14][^1_1][^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nIf the borrower challenges your proposed arbitrator, the tribunal (including the challenged arbitrator) decides on the challenge. However, be cautious – if the challenge has merit and you proceed anyway, the final award may be set aside under Section 34, wasting time and money.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nYou have 15 days from learning about bias/disqualification to challenge the arbitrator. Send written challenge to the tribunal stating specific reasons. If rejected, you can still participate in arbitration \"under protest\" and later challenge the final award citing arbitrator bias.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nFlexiLoan and borrower Manish start arbitration. Ten days into proceedings, Manish discovers that the arbitrator is a shareholder in FlexiLoan's parent company. Manish immediately (within 15 days) sends written challenge citing this undisclosed financial interest. The arbitrator refuses to recuse himself. Manish continues arbitration under protest. When the award goes against him, Manish files Section 34 application to set aside the award, successfully arguing that the arbitrator's undisclosed shareholding violated Section 12 and justified his Section 13 challenge.[^1_14]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 14 – When the Judge Can't Continue**\n\n**What it means:**\nAn arbitrator's mandate terminates if they become unable to perform functions (death, serious illness, mental incapacity), fail to act without undue delay, withdraw, or parties agree to terminate their mandate. If there's controversy about these grounds, a party can apply to court to decide on termination.[^1_15][^1_1][^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nIf the arbitrator is delaying indefinitely, you can apply to court under Section 14 for termination of mandate and appointment of substitute arbitrator. This prevents arbitrations from being held hostage by inactive arbitrators.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nIf the arbitrator is biased or deliberately delaying (perhaps favoring the lender), you can seek termination under Section 14. However, prove \"failure to act without undue delay\" or inability to perform functions – mere dissatisfaction with rulings isn't enough.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nIn arbitration between MoneyMart Finance and borrower Lakshmi over ₹10 lakhs, the sole arbitrator suffers a stroke three months into proceedings. The arbitrator cannot continue hearings. Both parties jointly apply to the High Court under Section 14, requesting termination of mandate. The court terminates the mandate and appoints a fresh arbitrator. Importantly, Section 15 provides that previous hearings can be repeated at the new tribunal's discretion.[^1_15][^1_2]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 15 – Getting a Replacement Judge**\n\n**What it means:**\nWhen an arbitrator's mandate terminates (under Section 13, 14, or by withdrawal/agreement), a substitute",

Importantly, Section 15 provides that previous hearings can be repeated at the new tribunal's discretion.[^1_15][^1_2]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 15 – Getting a Replacement Judge**\n\n**What it means:**\nWhen an arbitrator's mandate terminates (under Section 13, 14, or by withdrawal/agreement), a substitute arbitrator is appointed using the same rules that applied to the original appointment. Previous hearings may be repeated at the new tribunal's discretion. Orders made before substitution remain valid unless the tribunal decides otherwise.[^1_1][^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nArbitrator replacement doesn't void the entire proceeding. However, the new arbitrator may decide to rehear everything, potentially doubling time and cost. To avoid this, ensure your initial arbitrator selection is robust and they can commit to completing the matter.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nWhen an arbitrator is replaced, request the new arbitrator to rehear critical evidence, especially if the old arbitrator had made adverse preliminary rulings. The new tribunal has discretion to repeat hearings.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nEasyCredit's arbitration with borrower Rajiv is ongoing for 8 months. The arbitrator, having heard extensive evidence from both sides, suddenly resigns citing personal reasons. A substitute arbitrator is appointed under Section 15. EasyCredit wants to proceed based on previous hearings, but Rajiv requests the new arbitrator to rehear key witness testimony. The new arbitrator exercises discretion under Section 15(3) and orders partial re-hearing on contested points, balancing efficiency with fairness.[^1_2]\n\n***\n\n### **CHAPTER IV – JURISDICTION OF ARBITRAL TRIBUNALS**\n\n### **Section 16 – Can This Tribunal Even Hear My Case?**\n\n**What it means:**\nThe arbitral tribunal can decide on its own jurisdiction, including whether a valid arbitration agreement exists. An arbitration clause is treated as independent of the main contract (separability doctrine). A plea challenging jurisdiction must be raised no later than submission of defense statement. If the tribunal rejects jurisdiction challenges and proceeds, the aggrieved party can challenge the award under Section 34.[^1_16][^1_1][^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nEven if the borrower claims the entire loan agreement is void/forged, the arbitration clause within it is treated separately. The tribunal can first decide on jurisdiction. This prevents borrowers from derailing arbitration by attacking the underlying contract's validity.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nIf you believe the arbitration agreement itself is invalid (forged signature, fraud, coercion), raise this immediately in your first defense statement. Don't wait – if you participate without objecting to jurisdiction, you may waive this right (Section 4).\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nNetLoan Finance initiates arbitration against Sanjay for ₹18 lakh default. Sanjay claims the entire loan agreement was forged and he never signed it. Under Section 16, the arbitration clause is treated as separate from the loan agreement (separability). The tribunal first examines whether there's a valid arbitration agreement. After examining signatures and documents, the tribunal finds the agreement genuine and decides it has jurisdiction. Sanjay must now defend on merits. If still dissatisfied, he can later challenge the final award under Section 34 on jurisdictional grounds.[^1_16]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 17 – Emergency Powers of the Private Judge**\n\n**What it means:**\nThe arbitral tribunal can grant interim measures similar to court powers – protecting goods, securing disputed amounts, preventing asset dissipation, injunctions, appointing receivers, etc. These orders, once confirmed in appeal under Section 37, are deemed court orders and enforceable as such under the Civil Procedure Code.[^1_17][^1_4][^1_1][^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nOnce the tribunal is constituted, seek interim protection from the tribunal itself (rather than court under Section 9). Tribunal can order borrower to not sell mortgaged property, maintain security, provide bank guarantees, etc. These orders are enforceable as court decrees.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nThe tribunal has wide powers to grant you interim protection too. If the lender is harassing you, illegally repossessing assets, or not crediting your payments properly, seek interim relief from the tribunal. These orders have the force of court orders.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nDuring arbitration between AutoFinance Corp and borrower Amit over a ₹22 lakh vehicle loan, AutoFinance discovers Amit is trying to sell the financed vehicle (which is security). AutoFinance immediately applies to the arbitral tribunal under Section 17 for an interim injunction. The tribunal orders Amit to not sell, transfer, or encumber the vehicle until the final award. This order, being deemed a court order, is enforceable through contempt proceedings if Amit violates it.[^1_18][^1_17]\n\n***\n\n### **CHAPTER V – CONDUCT OF ARBITRAL PROCEEDINGS**\n\n### **Section 18 – The Golden Rule of Fairness**\n\n**What it means:**\nParties must be treated equally, and each party must have full opportunity to present their case. This is the principle of natural justice in arbitration.[^1_1][^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nYou cannot railroad the arbitration. Even if the borrower defaults or doesn't appear, the tribunal must give them adequate notice and opportunity to present defense. Violating Section 18 makes the award vulnerable to being set aside under Section 34.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**",

Even if the borrower defaults or doesn't appear, the tribunal must give them adequate notice and opportunity to present defense. Violating Section 18 makes the award vulnerable to being set aside under Section 34.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\n**Fundamental protection:** You must get equal treatment and adequate opportunity to present your case. If the tribunal hurries proceedings, denies you time to arrange evidence, or favors the lender, this violates Section 18 – a ground to set aside the award.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nIn arbitration between QuickCash NBFC and borrower Neha, QuickCash submits 500 pages of documents. The arbitrator gives Neha only 3 days to respond (versus 15 days given to QuickCash for their response). Neha objects citing Section 18 – unequal treatment. The tribunal grants her adequate time. Later, if the award goes against her and she can prove systematic unequal treatment, she can challenge the award under Section 34 for violation of natural justice.[^1_19]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 19 – Making Your Own Rules of the Game**\n\n**What it means:**\nThe tribunal is not bound by the Civil Procedure Code or Indian Evidence Act. Parties can agree on procedures, or failing agreement, the tribunal decides procedure. The tribunal has power to determine admissibility, relevance, materiality, and weight of evidence.[^1_20][^1_1][^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nArbitration is flexible – you're not bound by technical evidence rules. However, the tribunal controls procedure. You cannot insist on court-like procedures unless agreed in the arbitration clause. This speeds up proceedings but reduces predictability.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nThe tribunal can admit evidence that wouldn't be allowed in court (like hearsay), and reject evidence that would normally be admitted. The tribunal decides what evidence is relevant and what weight to give it. This flexibility can work for or against you.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nConsumer Finance initiates arbitration against borrower Kiran for ₹9 lakh EMI default. Kiran wants to present a medical expert's written opinion (without the expert appearing for cross-examination) showing he was mentally incapacitated when signing the loan. In court, this might be rejected as hearsay. But under Section 19, the tribunal has flexibility – it admits the written opinion, though giving it less weight due to lack of cross-examination, and allows Kiran to supplement with hospital records. The tribunal balances flexibility with fairness.[^1_20]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 20 – Where Does the Legal Battle Happen?**\n\n**What it means:**\nParties are free to agree on the place (seat) of arbitration. If they don't agree, the tribunal decides based on convenience and circumstances. The tribunal can meet anywhere for hearings, but the \"place\" (legal seat) determines which country's/state's law applies and which courts have supervisory jurisdiction.[^1_21][^1_1][^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nThe \"seat\" or \"place\" of arbitration in your agreement is crucial – it determines which courts can intervene (for appointment of arbitrators, interim relief, setting aside awards). Specify a seat where you have operational presence or favorable arbitration infrastructure.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nIf the loan agreement specifies arbitration seat as Mumbai but you're in Kerala, you may need to travel for hearings (though some can be virtual now). More importantly, you'd need to challenge any award in Mumbai courts, not Kerala. Try negotiating local seat or institutional rules allowing virtual proceedings.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nMoneyLine Finance (head office: Delhi) lends ₹30 lakhs to entrepreneur Vivek (based in Bangalore). The loan agreement states: \"Seat of arbitration: Delhi.\" Dispute arises. Despite most evidence and witnesses being in Bangalore, the legal seat is Delhi. Any Section 9 or Section 11 applications go to Delhi courts, and any Section 34 challenge to the award must be filed in Delhi. However, under Section 20(3), the tribunal can conduct hearings in Bangalore for convenience while maintaining Delhi as legal seat.[^1_22][^1_21]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 21 – When Does the Battle Officially Begin?**\n\n**What it means:**\nArbitration proceedings commence on the date when the request for arbitration is received by the respondent, unless parties have agreed on a different date.[^1_23][^1_1][^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nSend your arbitration notice/request by registered post or email with acknowledgment. The date respondent receives it starts the clock for limitation purposes and for calculating the 12-month timeline for award (Section 29A). Maintain proof of receipt.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nThe date you receive the arbitration notice is crucial – it starts limitation periods and timeline for filing responses. Respond promptly. Ignoring the notice doesn't stop the arbitration; it proceeds ex-parte.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nFinanceFirst sends arbitration notice to borrower Arjun via registered post on 15th January, which Arjun receives on 20th January. Under Section 21, arbitration proceedings commence on 20th January (unless the loan agreement specifies otherwise). Under Section 29A, the arbitrator must make the award within 12 months from the date of \"entering upon reference\" (usually constitution of tribunal). The tribunal is constituted on 15th February. Award must be made by 15th February next year (extendable by 6 months).[^1",

If they don't agree, the tribunal decides. The chosen language applies to written statements, hearings, awards, and communications. The tribunal can order translation of documents.[^1_25][^1_1][^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nIf your loan agreement is in English, specify English as the arbitration language. Otherwise, the tribunal might allow proceedings in the borrower's regional language, requiring you to translate all documents (adding cost and delay).\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nIf you're not comfortable in English and your loan agreement is in a regional language, you can request the tribunal to conduct proceedings in that language. However, if the arbitration clause specifies English, you'll need to arrange translation at your cost.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nRuralCredit NBFC lends to farmer Gopal in Maharashtra; the loan agreement is bilingual (Marathi and English) but arbitration clause says \"language: English.\" Gopal is barely literate in English. During arbitration, Gopal requests proceedings in Marathi under Section 22. The tribunal, considering Gopal's language abilities and that the operative loan documents are in Marathi, exercises discretion to allow Gopal to present evidence in Marathi with translation provided for NBFC's benefit, balancing fairness with practical efficiency.[^1_25]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 23 – The Written Battle: Claims and Defenses**\n\n**What it means:**\nWithin agreed time (or as determined by tribunal), the claimant states facts, issues, and relief sought; respondent states defense. Parties can submit counterclaims or set-offs if within arbitration scope. Parties may amend claims/defenses during proceedings unless the tribunal finds the amendment inappropriate due to delay.[^1_26][^1_1][^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nFile comprehensive statement of claim with all documents, showing loan disbursement, defaults, calculations, and relief sought. Be prepared for borrower to file counter-claims (like harassment, illegal charges). Under Section 23(2A), if counterclaim is within arbitration scope, it must be decided in the same proceedings.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nYour defense statement is crucial – include all factual defenses (payment made, usurious interest, misrepresentation). Also file counterclaim if applicable (for example, if lender overcharged you or harassed you). Include all grounds initially; late amendments may be rejected by tribunal.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nInstantCash files arbitration claim against borrower Sunita for ₹12 lakh principal + ₹4 lakh interest. Sunita files defense claiming she already paid ₹10 lakhs (which InstantCash failed to credit properly). Additionally, under Section 23(2A), Sunita files a counterclaim for ₹2 lakhs being illegal penalty charges collected by InstantCash. The tribunal is bound to adjudicate both claim and counterclaim in the same proceedings. Four months later, Sunita discovers new evidence of additional illegal charges worth ₹1 lakh. She seeks to amend her counterclaim under Section 23(3). The tribunal allows it as there's no undue delay.[^1_26]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 24 – Do We Need Court-Like Hearings?**\n\n**What it means:**\nThe tribunal decides whether to hold oral hearings or proceed based on documents and written submissions. However, if a party requests oral hearing, the tribunal must hold one at an appropriate stage.[^1_1][^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nIn small-value disputes with clear documentation, you can request document-based arbitration (no oral hearings) to save time and cost. However, if borrower requests oral hearing, the tribunal must grant it. In fast-track arbitration (Section 29B), oral hearings are generally not held unless parties agree.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nYou have the right to request oral hearing to present your case, cross-examine lender's witnesses, and explain your position directly. Don't waive this right unless the dispute is purely documentary and you're confident your written submissions are adequate.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nMicroLoan Finance files arbitration against borrower Farhan for ₹3 lakh based entirely on signed loan agreement and bank statements showing non-payment. MicroLoan requests document-only arbitration under Section 24 to save costs. Farhan, however, wants to explain that his business suffered due to lockdown and present hardship evidence. Farhan requests oral hearing. Under Section 24, the tribunal must provide oral hearing at appropriate stage. The tribunal schedules one hearing day where Farhan presents his case and is cross-examined, balancing efficiency with fairness.[^1_27]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 25 – When One Side Doesn't Show Up**\n\n**What it means:**\nIf claimant fails to submit statement of claim without sufficient cause, the tribunal may terminate proceedings. If respondent fails to submit defense, the tribunal continues but this isn't deemed admission. If a party fails to appear at hearing or produce evidence, the tribunal may continue and make the award based on available evidence.[^1_2][^1_1]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nIf borrower doesn't submit defense or doesn't appear, the tribunal can proceed ex-parte and make",

If respondent fails to submit defense, the tribunal continues but this isn't deemed admission. If a party fails to appear at hearing or produce evidence, the tribunal may continue and make the award based on available evidence.[^1_2][^1_1]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nIf borrower doesn't submit defense or doesn't appear, the tribunal can proceed ex-parte and make award based on your evidence alone. However, you must still prove your case – the tribunal cannot just assume borrower's default means your claim is valid.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\n**Critical warning:** If you don't respond or appear, the arbitration will proceed without you (ex-parte), and the tribunal will decide based only on the lender's evidence. You'll lose your chance to present defenses. Even if you cannot afford a lawyer, file a written defense and appear at hearings.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nSpeedyLoan initiates arbitration against borrower Pradeep for ₹15 lakh. Pradeep, assuming arbitration is just like court and will take years, ignores all notices. Under Section 25, the tribunal proceeds ex-parte. SpeedyLoan presents their case, documents, and calculations. The tribunal examines the evidence, verifies the claim, and makes an award in favor of SpeedyLoan. Pradeep later realizes an ex-parte arbitration award has been passed against him. His only remedy now is to challenge it under Section 34 on very limited grounds (like improper notice), not on merits.[^1_28][^1_7]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 26 – Bringing in the Expert**\n\n**What it means:**\nThe tribunal may appoint one or more experts to report on specific issues. The tribunal decides the expert's terms of reference. Parties must provide the expert with information and access to documents/goods/property for inspection. The expert's report is given to parties who can comment on it.[^1_1][^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nIn disputes involving technical issues (like valuation of mortgaged property, forensic accounting of payments, or assessment of business losses claimed by borrower), the tribunal can appoint independent experts. This ensures objective assessment rather than relying only on each party's partisan experts.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nIf complex technical issues arise (like whether interest calculation is correct, property valuation, or financial viability assessment), request the tribunal to appoint an independent expert under Section 26. This is more credible than each party presenting their own expert witnesses.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nPropertyLoans Ltd and borrower Madhav dispute property valuation for a ₹40 lakh home loan. Madhav claims the property (which is security) is now worth ₹80 lakhs (doubled), so he's repaid more than the loan value. PropertyLoans claims it's worth only ₹50 lakhs. Under Section 26, the tribunal appoints an independent certified valuer to inspect and value the property. The expert reports valuation of ₹65 lakhs. Both parties are given opportunity to comment on the report. The tribunal gives significant weight to this independent expert opinion while making final decision on the dispute.[^1_29]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 27 – When the Tribunal Needs Court's Help**\n\n**What it means:**\nThe tribunal or a party (with tribunal's approval) can apply to court for assistance in taking evidence. The court may order evidence to be produced directly to the tribunal or take evidence itself. Parties failing to comply face the same penalties as in court proceedings.[^1_30][^1_31][^1_32][^1_2][^1_1]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nIf a borrower or third party (like an employer holding salary) refuses to provide documents or testimony despite tribunal's order, you can seek court assistance under Section 27 to compel evidence production. This gives teeth to tribunal's evidence orders.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nIf you need documents from third parties (like your previous lender's loan closure statement, or employer's salary records) and they refuse to cooperate, the tribunal can get court assistance to compel production. This levels the playing field.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nDuring arbitration between FinCorp and borrower Rekha over ₹18 lakh debt, Rekha claims she already repaid ₹15 lakhs to FinCorp's previous owner (which later transferred the loan to FinCorp). The previous owner refuses to provide payment records. The tribunal, at Rekha's request, applies to the District Court under Section 27 for assistance. The court issues summons to the previous owner directing them to produce all payment records related to Rekha's loan. Non-compliance would attract contempt proceedings.[^1_32][^1_30]\n\n***\n\n### **CHAPTER VI – MAKING OF ARBITRAL AWARD AND TERMINATION OF PROCEEDINGS**\n\n### **Section 28 – What Law Applies to the Dispute?**\n\n**What it means:**\nFor domestic arbitration, the tribunal applies Indian substantive law. Parties can authorize the tribunal to decide based on equity and good conscience (ex aequo et bono) or as \"amiable compositeur\" only if expressly authorized. The tribunal must decide according to contract terms and take into account trade usages.[^1_2][^1_1]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nThe tribunal must apply Indian contract law, negotiable instruments law, and lending regulations (like usury laws, RBI guidelines). Parties cannot escape Indian law by choosing foreign law in domestic disputes. The contract terms are paramount.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nThe tribunal must follow Indian law protecting borrowers, including usury laws, consumer protection provisions, and RBI Fair Practices Code. If your contract violates Indian law (like",

Parties cannot escape Indian law by choosing foreign law in domestic disputes. The contract terms are paramount.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nThe tribunal must follow Indian law protecting borrowers, including usury laws, consumer protection provisions, and RBI Fair Practices Code. If your contract violates Indian law (like unconscionable penalty charges), the tribunal must strike those down despite the written contract.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nEliteLending's loan agreement with borrower Kavita contains a clause: \"Penalty for default: 50% of outstanding amount immediately becomes due.\" During arbitration, Kavita challenges this as unconscionable. Under Section 28, the tribunal must apply Indian contract law principles, particularly Section 74 of Indian Contract Act (penalty clauses). The tribunal finds the 50% penalty is actually penalty (not genuine pre-estimate of loss), and reduces it to reasonable compensation. The tribunal cannot simply enforce the written contract if it violates substantive Indian law.[^1_33]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 29 – How Does a Panel of Judges Decide?**\n\n**What it means:**\nWhen there are multiple arbitrators, decisions are made by majority unless parties agreed otherwise. The presiding arbitrator can decide procedural questions alone if authorized by parties or other arbitrators.[^1_1][^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nIf you opted for three arbitrators (one appointed by you, one by borrower, third by those two), expect that all three must hear the case, but majority decision binds. The presiding arbitrator (third arbitrator) often has slightly more influence on procedure.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nWith three arbitrators, you have better chance of balanced outcome – even if the lender's appointee favors them, if you chose well and the presiding arbitrator is fair, you have 2-out-of-3 majority. Dissenting opinions can be recorded but aren't binding.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nBigBank and borrower Sameer have three-arbitrator tribunal for a ₹1 crore loan dispute. After hearings, the tribunal deliberates. BigBank's appointee believes Sameer owes full ₹1 crore + interest + penalty = ₹1.4 crore. Sameer's appointee believes Sameer paid most of it and owes only ₹30 lakhs. The presiding arbitrator (neutral) carefully reviews evidence and concludes Sameer owes ₹75 lakhs. Under Section 29, the final award reflects the majority view: ₹75 lakhs (presiding arbitrator + Sameer's appointee). BigBank's appointee's dissent can be noted but doesn't change the award.[^1_34]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 29A – The 12-Month Deadline (with Extensions)**\n\n**What it means:**\nThe arbitral tribunal must make its award within 12 months from the date it enters upon reference (date of appointment/constitution). Parties can extend this by 6 months by agreement. Beyond that, court can grant extensions on application, but must record reasons. If award isn't made in time, the mandate terminates unless court extends it. Courts can reduce arbitrator's fees (up to 5% per month of delay) if delay is unjustified[29A].[^1_35][^1_36][^1_37][^1_24][^1_2][^1_1]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nThe 12-month timeline pressures tribunals to expedite proceedings. However, complex disputes may need extensions. Apply for extension before the deadline expires (not after). Budget for potential fee reduction if your appointed arbitrator causes delays. This provision aims to make arbitration genuinely faster than courts.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nYou're entitled to speedy justice – 12 months maximum (extendable to 18 months by mutual consent). If the lender or arbitrator is delaying tactics, the tribunal's mandate will terminate. However, courts routinely grant extensions on \"sufficient cause,\" so don't expect automatic termination.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nCreditHub initiates arbitration against borrower Aruna on 1st April 2024; tribunal constituted on 15th April 2024. Award must be made by 15th April 2025 (12 months). By March 2025, complex evidence is still being presented. Both parties agree to 6-month extension till 15th October 2025. Come September 2025, tribunal requests further extension citing voluminous documents. They apply to court under Section 29A(4). Court examines reasons, finds delay partly due to parties' frequent adjournment requests, partly due to tribunal's slow pace. Court grants 3-month extension but reduces tribunal's fees by 10% for the delays attributable to them[29A].[^1_37]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 29B – The Express Lane (Fast-Track Arbitration)**\n\n**What it means:**\nParties can agree (before or at time of tribunal appointment) to fast-track procedure. In fast-track: sole arbitrator only, no oral hearings unless parties agree, award within 6 months from tribunal's entry upon reference. Fees are as agreed between parties and arbitrator (Fourth Schedule doesn't apply)[29B].[^1_38][^1_39][^1_24][^1_35][^1_2][^1_1]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nFor smaller disputes (below ₹25 lakhs), include fast-track arbitration clause in loan agreements. This cuts time (6 months vs 12 months) and costs (single arbitrator, no hearings, lower fees",

Fees are as agreed between parties and arbitrator (Fourth Schedule doesn't apply)[29B].[^1_38][^1_39][^1_24][^1_35][^1_2][^1_1]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nFor smaller disputes (below ₹25 lakhs), include fast-track arbitration clause in loan agreements. This cuts time (6 months vs 12 months) and costs (single arbitrator, no hearings, lower fees by negotiation). However, limited hearing opportunity means your documentary evidence must be very strong.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nFast-track means quicker resolution but less opportunity to present your case orally or cross-examine lender's evidence. You can still agree to oral hearing within fast-track if both parties consent. If issues are complex or you need to present testimonial evidence, fast-track may not suit you – try to negotiate regular arbitration.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nSmallLoan NBFC's loan agreements for loans below ₹10 lakhs contain: \"Disputes resolved through fast-track arbitration under Section 29B.\" Borrower Vijay defaults on ₹8 lakh loan. SmallLoan invokes fast-track arbitration. Sole arbitrator appointed on 1st June. Both parties submit written claims, defenses, and documents by 30th June. Vijay requests oral hearing; SmallLoan opposes citing fast-track nature. Arbitrator decides to allow one brief virtual hearing (2 hours) to clarify key points. Award made by 30th November (within 6 months). Vijay got basic procedural fairness while SmallLoan got speed[29B].[^1_35]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 30 – Can We Settle and End This?**\n\n**What it means:**\nIf parties settle during arbitration, the tribunal can record the settlement as an arbitral award on agreed terms (consent award). Such awards have the same status and enforceability as regular arbitral awards.[^1_2][^1_1]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nSettlement during arbitration is common and beneficial – saves time, costs, and maintains relationship. Request the tribunal to record settlement as consent award under Section 30. This makes it enforceable like a court decree; if borrower later defaults on settlement terms, you can directly execute the award without fresh litigation.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nIf you reach settlement (like extended repayment schedule, reduced interest, or one-time settlement), insist it be recorded as consent award under Section 30. This protects you – the terms are clearly recorded, and lender cannot later demand more or file fresh proceedings on the same dispute.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nDuring arbitration between MaxCredit and borrower Sunil over ₹20 lakh outstanding, parties negotiate. MaxCredit agrees to: waive ₹3 lakh penalty, accept ₹17 lakh in 24 monthly installments of ₹70,833. Both request tribunal to record this as consent award under Section 30. The tribunal records the settlement as an award, signed and dated. If Sunil later defaults on the installment plan, MaxCredit can directly execute this consent award as a court decree under Section 36. If it were just a settlement agreement, MaxCredit would need to file fresh suit for breach of contract.[^1_40]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 31 – What Must the Final Judgment Contain?**\n\n**What it means:**\nThe award must be in writing, signed by arbitrators (in panel, majority signatures suffice), state reasons (unless parties waived or settlement award), mention date and place of arbitration. A copy is delivered to each party.[^1_1][^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nInsist on reasoned award (don't waive reasons) so you understand the tribunal's findings – useful if you need to enforce or if award is challenged. The award must specify the place of arbitration (important for enforcement and jurisdiction for challenge).\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nA reasoned award allows you to understand why you lost/won and whether there are grounds to challenge under Section 34. If the award lacks reasoning (and you didn't waive this right), that itself may be a ground to challenge the award.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nArbitration between LendFast and borrower Geeta concludes. The tribunal makes an award: \"We award Rs. 12,50,000 in favor of LendFast. Signed, Dated 15th Jan 2025, Place: Delhi.\" No reasons given. Geeta challenges this under Section 34, arguing the award must state reasons under Section 31. However, LendFast produces the loan agreement which states: \"Parties waive their right to reasoned award.\" Since parties waived this right, the award is valid despite lack of reasons. Had there been no waiver, lack of reasons would be a serious procedural defect.[^1_41]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 31A – Who Pays for This Battle?**\n\n**What it means:**\nThe tribunal or court (in proceedings under the Act) has discretion to determine costs and specify who bears them. Costs include arbitrators' fees, parties' legal costs, and other expenses. The principle generally is \"costs follow the event\" (loser pays), but tribunal/court has discretion.[^1_2][^1_1]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nIf you win the arbitration, request costs to be awarded against the borrower – this includes your legal fees, arbitrator's fees share, and administrative costs. However, the tribunal has discretion; if you made frivolous claims or caused unnecessary delays, you might bear your own costs despite winning.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nIf you successfully defend the arbitration or win counterclaim, request costs against the lender. This can include your lawyer's fees and your share of arbitrator's fees. Even",

This can include your lawyer's fees and your share of arbitrator's fees. Even if you partially win, you might get proportionate costs. Don't file frivolous counterclaims just to increase lender's costs – tribunal can penalize this.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nFinanceExpress claims ₹30 lakhs from borrower Nisha in arbitration. Nisha defends, proving she already paid ₹25 lakhs and owes only ₹5 lakhs. Tribunal awards ₹5 lakhs to FinanceExpress. Under Section 31A, Nisha requests costs, arguing FinanceExpress's claim was largely unjustified. Tribunal orders: Nisha pays ₹5 lakhs debt + 6% interest, but FinanceExpress pays Nisha's legal costs of ₹1.5 lakhs for having to defend against inflated claim. This balances the equities – FinanceExpress won technically but caused unnecessary litigation[31A].\n\n***\n\n### **Section 32 – When Does Everything End?**\n\n**What it means:**\nArbitral proceedings terminate when: (a) final award is made, (b) tribunal orders termination because claimant withdraws claim (unless respondent objects having legitimate interest in obtaining final settlement), (c) parties agree to terminate, or (d) tribunal finds it unnecessary or impossible to continue.[^1_1][^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nIf during arbitration the borrower repays the full debt, you can withdraw the claim under Section 32(2)(a). However, if borrower objects (maybe they want the tribunal to record that repayment was made with interest, not penalty), the tribunal may not allow termination without settling all disputes.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nIf you fully satisfy the lender's claim during arbitration, they can withdraw. But if you have counterclaims pending (like claim for harassment damages or refund of illegal charges), you can object to termination – the tribunal must settle all disputes, including your counterclaim.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nDuring arbitration between QuickLoans and borrower Ashok over ₹18 lakhs, Ashok arranges funds and repays the full ₹18 lakhs to QuickLoans. QuickLoans withdraws the claim under Section 32(2)(a), requesting termination. However, Ashok objects – he had filed a counterclaim for ₹3 lakhs illegal penalty charges that QuickLoans collected earlier, which is still pending. Since Ashok has \"legitimate interest in obtaining final settlement,\" the tribunal refuses termination and proceeds to adjudicate the counterclaim. Ultimately, tribunal passes final award directing QuickLoans to refund ₹2 lakhs to Ashok.[^1_42]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 33 – Oops, We Made a Mistake! (Correcting Awards)**\n\n**What it means:**\nWithin 30 days of receiving the award, a party may request the tribunal to: (a) correct computational/clerical/typographical errors, (b) give interpretation on specific points in the award, or (c) make additional award on claims presented but omitted from the award. The tribunal decides such requests within 30 days (extendable to 60 days).[^1_2][^1_1]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nIf the award contains calculation errors (like wrong interest computation) or missed addressing your claim for legal costs, immediately file Section 33 application for correction/additional award. This is cheaper and faster than challenging the award under Section 34.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nIf the award contains errors (like awarded ₹15,00,000 when calculation shows ₹14,50,000) or is ambiguous about repayment schedule, or didn't address your counterclaim at all, file Section 33 application within 30 days. The tribunal can correct mistakes without you needing to approach court.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nArbitral award directs borrower Rohit to pay \"₹12,50,000 @ 12% interest from date of loan.\" Rohit is confused – is the ₹12.5 lakhs inclusive of interest or is it principal + additional 12% interest? Within 30 days, Rohit files Section 33 application requesting clarification. The tribunal issues interpretation: \"The sum of ₹12,50,000 is principal; interest @ 12% per annum shall be calculated additionally from date of default (not date of loan) till payment.\" This clarification prevents future disputes about the exact liability.[^1_43]\n\n***\n\n### **CHAPTER VII – RECOURSE AGAINST ARBITRAL AWARD**\n\n### **Section 34 – The Last Resort: Setting Aside the Award**\n\n**What it means:**\nA party can apply to set aside (cancel) an arbitral award only on specific limited grounds: (a) party was incapable/under incapacity, arbitration agreement invalid under law, party wasn't given proper notice or couldn't present case, award deals with disputes not covered by arbitration agreement, composition of tribunal or procedure was not as agreed; or (b) award is contrary to public policy of India (which includes fraud/corruption, fundamental policy of Indian law violation, or patent illegality going to the root of the matter). Application must be filed within 3 months of receiving award (court may condone delay up to 30 days maximum). Court can set aside the entire award or part of it, or remit the award back to the tribunal for reconsideration.[^1_44][^1_45][^1_1][^1_2",

Court can set aside the entire award or part of it, or remit the award back to the tribunal for reconsideration.[^1_44][^1_45][^1_1][^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nThe grounds to set aside awards are very narrow – borrower cannot simply challenge the award by saying \"arbitrator got facts wrong\" or \"I disagree with the decision.\" This finality protects your award. However, if there was any procedural unfairness, fraud, or patent illegality, be prepared to defend the award. File the award in court under Section 36 promptly before borrower challenges it.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\n**This is your only chance to challenge the award** – you have 3 months from receiving it (with possible 30-day extension). However, grounds are limited: not mere disagreement with findings, but serious procedural violations, bias, fraud, or illegality that goes to the root. Consult a lawyer immediately on receiving an adverse award. After 3 months + 30 days, the award becomes final and unchallengeable.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nArbitrator awards ₹25 lakhs to PowerLend against borrower Meera. Meera examines the award and discovers: (a) the arbitrator was a director in PowerLend's parent company (never disclosed despite Section 12), (b) award includes ₹8 lakhs \"penalty charges\" though the contract said \"liquidated damages\" but they're clearly penalties (violates Section 74 of Contract Act – patent illegality). Meera files Section 34 application within 3 months, citing: (i) violation of Section 12 and natural justice (arbitrator's undisclosed conflict), and (ii) patent illegality (award of penalty contrary to law). Court finds merit, sets aside the award partially (removes the ₹8 lakh penalty portion), and remits the matter back to a fresh arbitrator for limited reconsideration on the penalty issue.[^1_45][^1_44]\n\n***\n\n### **CHAPTER VIII – FINALITY AND ENFORCEMENT OF ARBITRAL AWARDS**\n\n### **Section 35 – The Award is Final (Mostly)**\n\n**What it means:**\nAn arbitral award is final and binding on the parties and persons claiming under them. It's enforceable like a court decree, subject only to the provisions of Part I of the Act (i.e., subject to challenge under Section 34).[^1_1][^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nOnce the 3-month (+30 days) challenge period under Section 34 expires without challenge, or if Section 34 challenge is dismissed, your award is final. No further appeals on merits. Proceed to execute the award as a court decree. This finality is arbitration's key advantage over endless court appeals.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nThe arbitral award binds you completely. If you don't challenge it under Section 34 within time, you've lost your chance forever. The award is enforceable against you, your property, and can be executed just like a court judgment.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nArbitrator passes award on 1st March 2025 directing borrower Kishore to pay ₹15 lakhs to BrightFinance. Kishore receives the award on 5th March. He has until 5th June (3 months) + possible 30 days extension to challenge under Section 34. Kishore consults lawyer who advises the award is legally sound with no grounds to challenge. Kishore doesn't file Section 34 application. By 5th July 2025, the award becomes final and binding under Section 35. BrightFinance can now execute it. Even if Kishore later discovers new evidence, he cannot reopen the award – it's final.[^1_46]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 36 – Execution: Turning Paper into Money**\n\n**What it means:**\nOnce an arbitral award becomes enforceable (i.e., time for Section 34 challenge has expired, or Section 34 challenge has been disposed of), the award is deemed a court decree and can be executed under the Civil Procedure Code. No separate suit is needed. However, if a party files Section 34 application, the court may grant stay on the award on payment of money into court or furnishing security (but stay is not automatic).[^1_47][^1_2][^1_1]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nAfter winning the award, wait for the 3-month Section 34 challenge period. If no challenge is filed, file the award in the competent court with an execution application (like executing a money decree) – attach bank accounts, auction property, etc. If borrower files Section 34 challenge, immediately oppose their application for stay of award; court will usually require borrower to deposit substantial amount or furnish security before granting stay.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nIf you challenge the award under Section 34, also apply for stay of execution pending disposal of your challenge. However, the court will likely require you to deposit a substantial portion of the awarded amount or provide bank guarantee as condition for stay. If you cannot afford this, the award will be executed despite your challenge being pending.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nAward of ₹30 lakhs passed against borrower Sanjana in favor of UrbanLoans. Sanjana files Section 34 application alleging fraud, and also applies for stay of execution. Court hears the stay application: UrbanLoans argues Sanjana is filing frivolous challenge just",

    "content": ", the court will likely require you to deposit a substantial portion of the awarded amount or provide bank guarantee as condition for stay. If you cannot afford this, the award will be executed despite your challenge being pending.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nAward of ₹30 lakhs passed against borrower Sanjana in favor of UrbanLoans. Sanjana files Section 34 application alleging fraud, and also applies for stay of execution. Court hears the stay application: UrbanLoans argues Sanjana is filing frivolous challenge just to delay payment. Sanjana shows prima facie case of forgery of her signature on loan agreement. Court grants conditional stay under Section 36(3): Sanjana must deposit ₹10 lakhs (1/3rd of awarded amount) or furnish bank guarantee for ₹30 lakhs within 4 weeks; failing which, UrbanLoans can execute the award despite Section 34 application being pending.[^1_47]\n\n***\n\n### **CHAPTER IX – APPEALS**\n\n### **Section 37 – Can You Appeal? (Very Limited)**\n\n**What it means:**\nAppeals are allowed only against these orders: (a) refusing to refer parties to arbitration (Section 8), (b) granting/refusing interim measures (Section 9), (c) setting aside or refusing to set aside arbitral award (Section 34), (d) refusing enforcement of foreign awards. No second appeal is allowed; appeals must be filed within prescribed time. No appeal against orders appointing arbitrators (Section 11).[^1_38][^1_2][^1_1]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nIf the court sets aside your arbitral award under Section 34, you can appeal to the higher court under Section 37(1)(c). However, if court refuses your Section 9 interim relief application, your appeal is very limited and may not be fruitful. Importantly, no appeal against Section 11 orders appointing arbitrators – whoever the court appoints, you must proceed with them.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nIf your Section 34 challenge is dismissed and award is upheld, you can file one appeal under Section 37. But that's it – no further appeals (no second appeal to Supreme Court except under Article 136 in exceptional cases). Time is critical – file appeal within limitation period (usually 90 days). Also note: no appeal against arbitrator appointment orders.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nBorrower Ravi's Section 34 application to set aside the ₹20 lakh award is dismissed by the District Court. Ravi files appeal under Section 37(1)(c) in the High Court within 90 days. High Court hears the appeal and upholds the award. Ravi wants to appeal to Supreme Court, but there's no second appeal as of right under Section 37. Ravi's only option is Supreme Court's discretionary jurisdiction under Article 136 of Constitution, which is exercised only in exceptional cases involving substantial questions of law or gross injustice. Most likely, the High Court's decision is final.[^1_38]\n\n***\n\n### **CHAPTER X – MISCELLANEOUS**\n\n### **Section 38 – Paying into Court**\n\n**What it means:**\nWhere the arbitration agreement so provides, or where during arbitration the tribunal directs, parties may deposit sums of money with the court for arbitration costs.[^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nIf the tribunal orders both parties to deposit estimated arbitration costs (arbitrator's fees, venue charges) into court, comply promptly. Non-compliance may lead to termination of arbitration. This mechanism ensures arbitrators get paid and prevents disputes over fees later.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nIf ordered to deposit costs, try to negotiate payment in installments if you're financially constrained. However, failure to deposit may result in proceedings being suspended or terminated against you. The deposit is held by court and later paid to arbitrator or refunded based on final cost allocation.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nIn arbitration between MegaFinance and borrower Deepa involving ₹50 lakh claim, the three-member tribunal estimates total costs of ₹6 lakhs (₹5 lakhs arbitrators' fees + ₹1 lakh administrative costs). Tribunal directs each party to deposit ₹3 lakhs into court under Section 38 within 30 days. MegaFinance deposits promptly. Deepa delays. Tribunal warns that unless Deepa deposits within 15 more days, proceedings will be terminated as to her claims/defenses. This motivates Deepa to arrange funds and deposit.[^1_48]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 39 – Arbitrator's Security (Lien on Award)**\n\n**What it means:**\nThe arbitral tribunal has a lien (legal right to hold) on the arbitral award for unpaid arbitrator fees and costs. The tribunal isn't obliged to deliver the award until the fees are paid, unless parties have already deposited costs or made other payment arrangements.[^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nIf the arbitrator is demanding payment before releasing the award, and you're confident you've won, pay promptly to get the award. Delays in payment delay receipt of award, which delays execution. Ensure your arbitration agreement clearly specifies fee-sharing arrangement.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nIf you've lost, you might be tempted to delay paying the arbitrator to delay the final award. But under Section 39, the arbitrator can hold onto the award indefinitely until paid. The winning party (lender) will pressure you to pay to get the award released. Eventually, the lender may pay on your behalf and add it to the amount you owe them.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nArbitration concludes; tribunal favors WealthCredit with ₹28 lakh award against borrower Sandeep. Total arbitrator fees of ₹4 lakhs are due (₹2 lakhs from each party per agreement). WealthCredit pays",

Total arbitrator fees of ₹4 lakhs are due (₹2 lakhs from each party per agreement). WealthCredit pays its ₹2 lakhs share. Sandeep refuses to pay, hoping to delay award. Under Section 39, the arbitrator exercises lien and refuses to release/deliver the signed award until full fees are paid. After 2 months, WealthCredit pays Sandeep's ₹2 lakh share as well (adding it to the principal debt). The arbitrator releases the award. WealthCredit later executes the award including the additional ₹2 lakhs it paid on behalf of Sandeep.[^1_31]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 40 – Death Doesn't End Arbitration**\n\n**What it means:**\nAn arbitration agreement is not discharged by the death of a party to it; it binds the legal representatives (legal heirs/estate executors) of the deceased party.[^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nIf the borrower dies during arbitration (or before arbitration commences), the arbitration agreement still binds the borrower's legal heirs. You can continue or commence arbitration against the legal heirs. This is crucial for recovery – you don't need to prove the debt afresh in succession proceedings.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nIf you're the legal heir of a deceased borrower whose loan agreement had an arbitration clause, you're bound by it. You cannot refuse arbitration claiming you didn't sign the agreement. However, you can defend on merits (like debt was already paid, or it was fraudulent loan).\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nRamesh takes a ₹25 lakh business loan from StartupFin with arbitration clause. Ramesh dies in an accident. His widow Lakshmi and son Arun are legal heirs. StartupFin initiates arbitration against Lakshmi and Arun (as legal representatives of deceased Ramesh's estate) for ₹30 lakhs outstanding. Lakshmi objects, claiming they never agreed to arbitration. Under Section 40, the objection fails – the arbitration agreement binds Ramesh's estate and his legal representatives. Arbitration proceeds. However, Lakshmi can defend on merits, including claiming the estate has limited assets or the debt was invalid.[^1_24]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 41 – Insolvency's Impact**\n\n**What it means:**\nWhere a party to an arbitration agreement becomes insolvent, the arbitration agreement becomes inoperative except with permission of the insolvency court/tribunal. Any pending arbitration abates. This aligns with insolvency law which centralizes all creditor claims before the insolvency authority.[^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nIf the borrower enters insolvency proceedings (under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code), you cannot proceed with arbitration without permission of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) / Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT). Your claim becomes part of the insolvency proceedings. The arbitration agreement is effectively suspended during insolvency.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nIf you're undergoing insolvency resolution, the lender cannot arbitrarily continue arbitration against you. All claims must be submitted to the insolvency resolution professional. This provides you a breathing space from multiple legal proceedings and consolidates all debts in one forum.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nGlobalCredit initiates arbitration against borrower company TechStart Pvt Ltd for ₹1 crore loan default. After hearings begin, TechStart's board admits insolvency and Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) is initiated under IBC, 2016. An Interim Resolution Professional (IRP) is appointed. Under Section 41 of Arbitration Act read with Section 14 of IBC (moratorium), the arbitration proceedings are automatically stayed. GlobalCredit must now submit its claim to the IRP along with other creditors. The arbitration cannot proceed unless NCLT specifically permits it (which is rare).[^1_49]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 42 – Which Court Has Power?**\n\n**What it means:**\nThe court having jurisdiction over the arbitration is the one that would have jurisdiction over the subject matter of the arbitration if it were a civil suit. For appointments, interim relief, setting aside awards, etc., only this designated court has jurisdiction. Parties can file application at the place where arbitration is seated, where respondent/applicant resides, or where cause of action arose, subject to arbitration agreement.[^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nThe \"seat\" of arbitration mentioned in your loan agreement's arbitration clause is critical – that location's courts have jurisdiction for Section 9, 11, 34 applications. If your office is in Mumbai but you specified arbitration seat as Delhi, Delhi courts have exclusive jurisdiction for arbitration-related matters.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nCheck the arbitration clause for \"seat\" or \"place\" of arbitration. That determines which courts you need to approach for any arbitration-related relief. If the seat is in a distant city, this increases your costs and difficulty in accessing justice. Try negotiating a local seat or institutional arbitration with virtual proceedings.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nModernLoans (office: Bangalore) lends to borrower Harsh (resident: Jaipur). Loan agreement states: \"Arbitration seat: Mumbai.\" Dispute arises. Harsh wants to file Section 34 application challenging the arbitral award. Under Section 42, he must file in the court within whose jurisdiction Mumbai falls (likely Bombay High Court or designated District Court in Mumbai), not in Jaipur courts or Bangalore courts. This requires Harsh to either travel to Mumbai multiple times or engage Mumbai",

Under Section 42, he must file in the court within whose jurisdiction Mumbai falls (likely Bombay High Court or designated District Court in Mumbai), not in Jaipur courts or Bangalore courts. This requires Harsh to either travel to Mumbai multiple times or engage Mumbai-based lawyers, increasing his costs.[^1_32]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 43 – Time Limits for Arbitration**\n\n**What it means:**\nThe Limitation Act, 1963 applies to arbitrations as it applies to court proceedings. The limitation period for filing arbitration (or court suit) depends on the nature of claim – for money claims on contracts, it's generally 3 years from when the cause of action arises. For invoking arbitration when already proceedings are ongoing, time limits specified elsewhere in the Act apply.[^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nIf the borrower defaults, you have 3 years from the date of default (or last EMI payment) to commence arbitration. If you delay beyond 3 years, your claim becomes time-barred. However, each missed EMI payment may be a fresh cause of action. Send legal notices and commence arbitration within limitation to preserve your claim.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nIf you want to invoke arbitration to challenge some aspect of the loan, you have 3 years from when your cause of action arose (like from when you discovered illegal charges were deducted). If the lender delays commencing arbitration beyond limitation, you can plead limitation as a defense – the tribunal may reject their claim as time-barred.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nPayLater Finance lent ₹20 lakhs to borrower Amit in January 2018. Amit defaulted on the EMI due in February 2019. PayLater sent demand notices but took no legal action. In August 2023 (over 4 years later), PayLater initiates arbitration. Amit pleads Section 43 (applying Article 113 of Limitation Act – 3 years for money claims). The tribunal finds that the cause of action arose in February 2019 (date of default), so limitation expired in February 2022. Arbitration initiated in August 2023 is barred by limitation. However, if Amit made any part payment or acknowledged the debt in between, limitation would restart from that date.[^1_35]\n\n***\n\n## **PART IA – ARBITRATION COUNCIL OF INDIA**\n\n*Note: Part IA (Sections 43A to 43M) provides for establishment of the Arbitration Council of India to grade arbitral institutions and accredit arbitrators. These sections are administrative in nature and have limited direct impact on individual loan disputes between lenders and borrowers. They establish a regulatory framework for professionalizing arbitration in India. For brevity and relevance to money-lending disputes, detailed individual explanation of Sections 43A-43M is omitted, as they govern the Council's structure, functions, grading criteria, and procedures rather than substantive rights of parties in disputes.*\n\n***\n\n## **PART II – ENFORCEMENT OF CERTAIN FOREIGN AWARDS**\n\n### **CHAPTER I – NEW YORK CONVENTION AWARDS**\n\n### **Section 44 – What is a Foreign Award?**\n\n**What it means:**\nA \"foreign award\" under this chapter means an arbitral award made in a country that is signatory to the New York Convention (1958), and India must have declared that country as a reciprocating territory. The award must arise from international commercial disputes.[^1_23][^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nIf you're a foreign lender or have international operations, and your borrower is in India, an award made in a foreign country (like Singapore, UK, USA – New York Convention signatories) can be enforced in India under this chapter. Specify a New York Convention country as the seat of arbitration in cross-border loan agreements.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nIf you took a loan from a foreign lender with arbitration seat outside India (in a New York Convention country), the foreign arbitral award can be enforced against you in India. You have limited defenses under Section 48. International arbitration is generally more expensive for you.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nUS-based FinGlobal lends \\$500,000 to Indian company ExportCo, with arbitration clause specifying seat as Singapore (New York Convention signatory). ExportCo defaults. Arbitration held in Singapore results in award favoring FinGlobal for \\$600,000. FinGlobal can enforce this foreign award in Indian courts under Section 44-52. ExportCo cannot refuse enforcement simply by saying \"this is a foreign award\" – India recognizes and enforces New York Convention awards.[^1_50][^1_23]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 45 – Foreign Arbitration Agreement Must Be Respected**\n\n**What it means:**\nIf a court case is filed in India on a matter subject to a foreign arbitration agreement (covered by New York Convention), the court must refer parties to arbitration unless it finds the arbitration agreement is null, inoperative, or incapable of being performed.[^1_23][^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nIf your loan agreement with an Indian borrower specifies foreign arbitration (in a New York Convention country), and the borrower files suit in Indian court, you can invoke Section 45 to get the matter referred to arbitration. This parallels Section 8 but for foreign arbitration agreements.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nYou cannot bypass a valid foreign arbitration clause by filing suit in Indian courts. If the lender invokes Section 45, the Indian court will refer the matter to arbitration in the foreign jurisdiction specified in the agreement (unless you prove the arbitration agreement",

If the lender invokes Section 45, the Indian court will refer the matter to arbitration in the foreign jurisdiction specified in the agreement (unless you prove the arbitration agreement is invalid).\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nLondon-based BritLoan lends £200,000 to Indian businessman Vikram, with arbitration clause: \"Disputes arbitrated in London under ICC Rules.\" Vikram defaults and files a civil suit in Delhi High Court claiming the loan agreement is void. BritLoan files Section 45 application with copy of arbitration agreement. Delhi High Court examines the arbitration clause, finds it valid and governed by New York Convention, and refers parties to arbitration in London. Vikram's Indian suit is dismissed with liberty to proceed to arbitration.[^1_36]\n\n***\n\n### **Sections 46-52 – Enforcement of Foreign Awards**\n\n**What they mean:**\nThese sections provide the procedure for enforcing foreign arbitral awards in India. Section 46: Foreign awards are binding and recognized in India. Section 47: Party seeking enforcement must produce original award (or certified copy), proof of finality, and evidence. Section 48: Grounds for refusing enforcement (similar to Section 34) – invalid agreement, improper notice, beyond scope, improper procedure, not final, or contrary to public policy. Section 49: Enforced awards are treated as court decrees. Sections 50-52: Appeals and savings.[^1_51][^1_23][^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company (Foreign Lender):**\nWinning a foreign arbitral award is only half the battle – you must enforce it in India where the borrower's assets are located. File enforcement application in the appropriate Indian court (usually High Court) with the award and supporting documents. The borrower can resist enforcement only on limited grounds under Section 48. Once enforced, the award becomes a decree and you can execute it against the borrower's Indian assets.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nIf a foreign lender obtains an arbitral award against you abroad and seeks to enforce it in India, you can resist enforcement under Section 48 – but grounds are very limited (similar to Section 34). You cannot re-argue the merits. If enforcement is granted, the foreign award becomes an Indian court decree and the lender can attach your properties, bank accounts, etc.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nDubai-based SheikhFinance obtains arbitral award from Dubai International Arbitration Centre (DIAC) against Indian borrower Sanjiv for AED 2 million (approx. ₹4.5 crores). SheikhFinance files enforcement application in Delhi High Court under Sections 47-49, producing the award, proof of finality, and evidence. Sanjiv opposes enforcement citing Section 48, claiming he was not given proper notice of arbitration. High Court examines evidence, finds Sanjiv was served notice at his email address (as per agreement) and participated in initial stages before withdrawing. Court finds no Section 48 grounds satisfied. The foreign award is enforced – treated as Delhi High Court decree. SheikhFinance proceeds to execute against Sanjiv's properties in India.[^1_51]\n\n***\n\n### **CHAPTER II – GENEVA CONVENTION AWARDS**\n\n### **Sections 53-60 – Older Foreign Award Regime**\n\n**What they mean:**\nThese sections govern enforcement of foreign arbitral awards under the older Geneva Convention (1927). The principles are similar to New York Convention but apply to fewer countries. Section 53 defines foreign awards under Geneva Convention. Sections 54-60 provide mechanism for referring parties to arbitration and enforcing such awards in India.[^1_26][^1_23][^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nGeneva Convention is now less relevant as most countries have acceded to the newer New York Convention. However, if dealing with a country that's only party to Geneva Convention (not New York), these sections apply. Practically, for modern international lending, focus on New York Convention.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nIf you're dealing with a very old foreign arbitral award or a lender from a Geneva-Convention-only country, these sections govern enforcement. The principles are similar to New York Convention but with slightly different procedures.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nSwiss lender AlpineBank obtained an arbitral award in 1998 under Geneva Convention against Indian company OldTrade Ltd (before India acceded to New York Convention for Switzerland). AlpineBank now seeks to enforce this old award. Sections 53-60 provide the framework. However, this is rare in modern practice – most foreign award enforcement now happens under New York Convention (Sections 44-52).[^1_23][^1_26]\n\n***\n\n## **PART III – CONCILIATION**\n\n*Note: Conciliation is an alternative dispute resolution method where a neutral conciliator helps parties reach a voluntary settlement. Unlike arbitration, the conciliator doesn't impose a decision – parties must agree. Conciliation is relevant for money-lending disputes as a pre-arbitration or alternative mechanism to preserve relationships while resolving disputes.*\n\n### **Section 61 – When Does Conciliation Apply?**\n\n**What it means:**\nPart III applies to conciliation of disputes arising from legal relationships (contractual or otherwise), unless parties agreed otherwise or some law prohibits conciliation of certain disputes.[^1_48][^1_49][^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nYou can include a conciliation clause in loan agreements: \"Disputes shall first be attempted to be resolved through conc",

Conciliation is particularly useful for borrowers facing genuine hardship (pandemic, business loss) where negotiated restructuring benefits both parties.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nIf your loan agreement has a conciliation clause, or if the lender proposes conciliation, participate actively. Conciliation is non-binding until settlement is reached – you can walk away if terms aren't acceptable. It's less adversarial than arbitration and gives you chance to explain your circumstances and negotiate manageable repayment terms.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nRuralMicroFin lends to 1000 small borrowers with clause: \"Disputes shall first attempt conciliation.\" During pandemic, 300 borrowers default. Instead of filing 300 arbitrations, RuralMicroFin initiates conciliation proceedings. A neutral conciliator meets with borrower groups, understands hardships, and facilitates settlement: extended repayment period, partial interest waiver. 250 borrowers agree to settlement (recorded under Section 73), resolving disputes quickly. Remaining 50 proceed to arbitration. Conciliation saved enormous time and costs for both sides.[^1_52][^1_49]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 62 – How Does Conciliation Start?**\n\n**What it means:**\nOne party sends written invitation to the other party to conciliate, briefly identifying the dispute. Conciliation commences when the other party accepts the invitation in writing. If invitation is rejected, there's no conciliation.[^1_48][^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nTo initiate conciliation, send formal invitation to borrower identifying the dispute (EMI defaults, outstanding amount, etc.). If borrower accepts, conciliation commences. If borrower rejects or doesn't respond within reasonable time, you can proceed directly to arbitration.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nIf you receive conciliation invitation, consider accepting – it gives you opportunity to negotiate without adversarial proceedings. Accepting doesn't mean conceding liability; it just means you're willing to discuss settlement. If conciliation fails, you can still defend in arbitration later.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nUrbanFinance sends conciliation invitation to borrower Anita: \"We invite conciliation to resolve outstanding amount of ₹8 lakhs on your loan. Please confirm acceptance within 15 days.\" Anita responds: \"I accept invitation for conciliation. However, I dispute ₹2 lakhs as illegal charges.\" Under Section 62, conciliation proceedings have commenced. Both parties now work with a conciliator to resolve the dispute. The fact that Anita disputes part of the claim doesn't prevent conciliation – that's what conciliation is meant to resolve.[^1_53][^1_48]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 63 – How Many Conciliators?**\n\n**What it means:**\nThere shall be one conciliator unless parties agree on two or three. Multiple conciliators should generally act jointly.[^1_48][^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nFor most loan disputes, a sole conciliator is sufficient and cost-effective. For large or complex disputes, parties might agree on three conciliators for broader perspectives.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nUnless you have specific reasons to insist on multiple conciliators (like wanting diverse perspectives), agree to a sole conciliator to keep process simple and costs low.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nBankCorp and borrower company TechManufacturing have a ₹5 crore loan dispute. Given the complexity, they agree on three conciliators under Section 63: one with finance expertise, one with legal expertise, and one with industry expertise. The three conciliators work jointly, bringing multidisciplinary perspective to facilitate settlement discussions.[^1_54][^1_48]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 64 – Appointing the Peacemaker**\n\n**What it means:**\nFor sole conciliator, parties may agree on a name. For two conciliators, each party appoints one. For three conciliators, each party appoints one and parties agree on the third. Parties may seek assistance from institutions for appointments.[^1_48][^1_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nMaintain a panel of qualified conciliators or tie-up with conciliation institutions (like MCCIA, IIAM) for neutral appointments. Avoid unilateral appointment clauses which create perception of bias.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nParticipate in conciliator selection. Ensure the conciliator is truly neutral – someone with experience in financial disputes, known for fairness, not someone closely associated with lender.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nConsumerLoan and borrower Prakash agree to conciliation. Under Section 64(1)(a), they jointly select retired banker Mr. Sharma as sole conciliator, respecting his experience and impartiality. Had they disagreed, they could have approached an institution like the Indian Institute of Arbitration \\& Mediation (IIAM) to suggest a neutral conciliator.[^1_55][^1_48]\n\n***\n\n---\n***\n\n## **PART III – CONCILIATION (Continued)**\n\n### **Section 66 – The Conciliator is Not Bound by Court Rules**\n\n**Section Number:** 66\n\n**Simple Title:** Conciliator Not Bound by Civil Procedure Code or Evidence Act\n\n**What it means:**\nThe conciliator is not bound by the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 (CPC)",

The conciliator decides the procedure themselves and can accept evidence that wouldn't normally be admissible in court.[^2_1][^2_2][^2_3]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nThis flexibility allows you to present business records, internal memos, email communications, and other informal evidence without strict procedural formalities. You don't need to follow court rules for document authentication or witness examination. This speeds up the conciliation process.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nYou can present your side informally without worrying about technical legal procedures. You can submit family WhatsApp messages showing you discussed hardship with the lender, personal health records explaining inability to pay, or business documents showing losses – evidence that might not be admissible in court can be considered by the conciliator.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nDuring conciliation between UrbanCredit and borrower Rahul over ₹18 lakh outstanding, under Section 66, the conciliator accepts: (i) Rahul's unattested photocopy of salary slips showing reduced salary; (ii) screenshots of WhatsApp conversation between Rahul and UrbanCredit's manager (discussing hardship); (iii) Rahul's personal health records (in Marathi) showing medical expenses that depleted savings. In court, these might face authentication issues. But under Section 66, the conciliator considers all these to understand Rahul's circumstances and facilitate settlement. This informal approach helps conciliator grasp ground realities.[^2_2][^2_4]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 67 – The Conciliator's Role and Duty (The Neutral Bridge)**\n\n**Section Number:** 67\n\n**Simple Title:** Role of Conciliator – Neutrality, Fairness, and Settlement Focus\n\n**What it means:**\nThe conciliator's role is to assist parties in reaching an amicable settlement amicably and expeditiously. The conciliator must be independent and impartial, act fairly and in good faith, and consider: (a) the rights and obligations of parties, (b) usages and practices in trade/commerce, (c) circumstances of the dispute including prior dealings between parties. The conciliator has absolute discretion in procedure and can propose settlement terms at any stage.[^2_3][^2_1][^2_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nThe conciliator will consider your legitimate business interests (recovering debt, avoiding precedent of waiving principal) but also expects fairness. If the borrower genuinely faces hardship and can afford restructured payment, the conciliator will push for a realistic settlement. Participate genuinely; don't come to conciliation just for show.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nThe conciliator is truly neutral – not on either side. They'll push both lender and borrower to move towards middle ground. Be transparent about your circumstances. The conciliator can propose creative solutions (like extending repayment period, reducing interest, or converting part of debt to smaller monthly installments). Listen to the conciliator's suggestions – they're aimed at fair settlement benefiting both sides.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nIn conciliation between BusinessFinance and borrower Priya over ₹25 lakh business loan, Priya claims total hardship; BusinessFinance says Priya is misusing funds. Under Section 67, the conciliator: (i) meets both separately to understand their positions, (ii) reviews the loan agreement and Priya's business records, (iii) considers trade practice (in Priya's industry, how many businesses survive pandemic downturn?), (iv) notes prior dealings (was Priya's initial repayment record good?), and (v) proposes: \"Priya pays ₹20 lakhs over 36 months instead of 24 months; remaining ₹5 lakhs converted to zero-interest loan payable after 3 years when business recovers; BusinessFinance waives penalties.\" This balanced proposal under Section 67 becomes acceptable to both sides.[^2_5][^2_2]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 68 – Getting Administrative Help in Conciliation**\n\n**Section Number:** 68\n\n**Simple Title:** Administrative Assistance for Conciliation Proceedings\n\n**What it means:**\nThe parties or conciliator can arrange for administrative assistance from suitable institutions or persons (similar to Section 6 for arbitration). This helps with scheduling, document management, venue, etc..[^2_2][^2_3]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nEngage a professional conciliation institution (like IIAM – Indian Institute of Arbitration \\& Mediation, or JAMS – Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services) to manage the administrative aspects. This brings professionalism, maintains confidentiality, and ensures neutral environment.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nInstitutional support ensures the conciliation isn't just in a lender's office where you might feel uncomfortable speaking freely. A neutral institution with trained administrative staff creates balanced environment.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nSamllBiz NBFC and borrower Arun agree to conciliation. Instead of meeting at NBFC's office, they engage IIAM (Indian Institute of Arbitration \\& Mediation) under Section 68 to provide administrative support. IIAM: (i) provides neutral venue (their office), (ii) arranges video conferencing for parties in different cities, (iii) maintains confidential file, (iv) schedules meetings, (v) manages document exchange, (vi) arranges interpreter if needed. This institutional support",

This institutional support makes conciliation more credible and accessible.[^2_6][^2_2]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 69 – How the Conciliator Communicates (Flexible Communication Methods)**\n\n**Section Number:** 69\n\n**Simple Title:** Communication Between Conciliator and Parties – Joint and Separate Meetings\n\n**What it means:**\nThe conciliator can communicate with parties through written or oral means, as the conciliator considers appropriate. The conciliator can meet parties jointly or separately (caucusing). The conciliator also determines when to communicate and which parties to communicate with. This flexibility in communication methods facilitates settlement.[^2_1][^2_3][^2_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nThe conciliator might hold separate meetings with you (caucuses) to discuss your actual bottom line without the borrower present. In a joint meeting, you might take a hardline; in a separate meeting, you might admit you can accept restructuring. Use separate meetings strategically to signal flexibility.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nSeparate meetings (caucuses) are your opportunity to speak frankly with the conciliator – explain genuine hardship, your maximum payment capacity, emotional stress. You don't need to maintain a \"tough defense\" in front of the lender. The conciliator can then explore with the lender whether your offer is acceptable. Some borrowers find caucuses more comfortable than confrontational joint meetings.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nIn conciliation between LoanMax and borrower Sanjay, the conciliator under Section 69: (i) holds a joint meeting where LoanMax claims ₹20 lakhs outstanding and Sanjay insists he can pay only ₹5 lakhs (wide gap); (ii) meets LoanMax separately – they admit they can accept ₹18 lakhs if structured over 48 months with 3% interest; (iii) meets Sanjay separately – he admits he can actually afford ₹12 lakhs over 36 months but was afraid to offer more in front of aggressive lender. Conciliator now proposes middle ground via separate communications: LoanMax gets ₹15 lakhs over 40 months at 5% interest. Both find this acceptable through caucusing.[^2_7][^2_2]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 70 – What Can the Conciliator Disclose? (Confidentiality with Exceptions)**\n\n**Section Number:** 70\n\n**Simple Title:** Disclosure of Information by Conciliator – When Information Can Be Shared\n\n**What it means:**\nInformation given by one party to the conciliator may be disclosed to the other party, except where a party objects. However, the conciliator can disclose any information agreed to be disclosed by both parties or information already in the public domain or essential for implementing settlement.[^2_3][^2_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nIf you tell the conciliator (in separate meeting) your actual bottom line and conciliator asks \"Can I share this with the borrower?\", you can object – then the conciliator won't disclose your exact limits. However, conciliator might paraphrase: \"Lender might be open to ₹18 lakhs\" without revealing your exact figures.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nIf in a separate meeting you share sensitive information (like \"My business is bankrupt, I have no other funds\"), you can request the conciliator keep it confidential. However, general information like \"I can pay ₹10 lakhs\" the conciliator may share with lender (unless you specifically object). Be strategic about what you mark as confidential.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nDuring caucus between conciliator and borrower Meera under Section 70, Meera reveals: \"I took ₹3 lakhs from my parents to make partial payment to the lender. I cannot ask them for more. My maximum capacity is ₹2 lakhs additional payment.\" Meera requests: \"Please don't tell the lender that I borrowed from my parents – they'll think I'm just hiding money.\" Conciliator agrees to keep that confidential. But conciliator tells the lender: \"Borrower has limited additional funds, can realistically pay ₹2 lakhs more, total ₹5 lakhs.\" The specific source (parents' loan) remains confidential under Section 70, but relevant payment capacity is disclosed.[^2_8][^2_2]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 71 – Parties Must Cooperate (Good Faith Obligation)**\n\n**Section Number:** 71\n\n**Simple Title:** Parties' Obligation to Cooperate with Conciliator in Good Faith\n\n**What it means:**\nParties shall in good faith cooperate with the conciliator and endeavor to comply with the conciliator's requests to: (i) submit written materials (documents, statements), (ii) provide evidence (witness testimony, expert reports), (iii) attend meetings. Parties cannot ignore conciliator's requests.[^2_9][^2_2][^2_3]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nYou must provide complete documentation (loan agreement, payment records, default notices, communication history) to the conciliator. If the conciliator asks you to appear for a meeting, you cannot skip it. This good faith obligation ensures conciliation isn't bypassed by one party's non-cooperation.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nYou're equally obligated to provide financial documents (tax returns, business records",

If the conciliator asks you to appear for a meeting, you cannot skip it. This good faith obligation ensures conciliation isn't bypassed by one party's non-cooperation.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nYou're equally obligated to provide financial documents (tax returns, business records, bank statements), attend meetings, and communicate honestly. If you ignore conciliator's requests, the conciliator can terminate conciliation under Section 76 and you lose the settlement opportunity.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nDuring conciliation between CapitalPlus and borrower Arjun, conciliator requests Arjun to submit: (i) last 2 years' income tax returns, (ii) current bank statements, (iii) evidence of assets/liabilities. Under Section 71, Arjun cannot refuse claiming \"privacy\" – good faith cooperation is mandatory. Arjun submits documents. Conciliator sees Arjun's actual financial position: ₹8 lakhs annual income, ₹5 lakhs monthly expenses (including ₹2 lakhs loan EMIs on other debts). Based on this, conciliator proposes realistic restructuring: ₹12 lakh CapitalPlus debt spread over 60 months = ₹20,000/month, now manageable within Arjun's budget. Without Section 71's cooperation obligation, Arjun might have hidden true finances.[^2_10][^2_2]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 72 – Parties Can Suggest Settlement Terms (Joint Problem-Solving)**\n\n**Section Number:** 72\n\n**Simple Title:** Parties' Right to Suggest Settlement Terms\n\n**What it means:**\nAt any time during conciliation, either party may submit suggestions to the conciliator (at conciliator's invitation or on party's initiative) for settlement of the dispute. The parties are not limited to reacting to the conciliator's proposals – they can take active role in proposing terms.[^2_2][^2_3]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nDon't passively wait for conciliator's proposals. Proactively submit your settlement proposal: \"We're willing to: (i) waive penalties, (ii) reduce interest rate to 8%, (iii) extend repayment to 48 months, (iv) restructure with grace period if borrower faces genuine temporary hardship.\" This shows flexibility and moves settlement forward.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nYou too can submit proposals. Don't wait for lender or conciliator – propose your realistic plan: \"I can pay ₹5 lakhs now, restructure remaining ₹15 lakhs into 36 monthly installments of ₹42,000 after 2-month grace period.\" Proactive proposals show seriousness and often receive positive response.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nIn conciliation between InstantLoan and borrower Deepak under Section 72, Deepak proactively submits written proposal: \"Given my business downturn during pandemic, I propose: (i) ₹4 lakhs one-time payment now, (ii) remaining ₹11 lakhs converted to personal guarantee from my father, (iii) 36-month repayment schedule starting after 6 months, (iv) interest rate reduced from 15% to 12%.\" InstantLoan, seeing Deepak's initiative and father's personal guarantee (additional security), responds positively. Conciliator then refines the proposal with both parties. This gives-and-takes through Section 72 suggestions leads to quicker settlement than conciliator unilaterally proposing terms.[^2_1][^2_2]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 73 – Formalizing the Settlement Agreement (The Binding Deal)**\n\n**Section Number:** 73\n\n**Simple Title:** Settlement Agreement – Formation, Formulation, and Authentication\n\n**What it means:**\nSection 73(1): When the conciliator finds elements of a possible settlement acceptable to both parties, the conciliator formulates the settlement terms and submits to parties for their observations. After receiving observations, conciliator may reformulate the terms.\n\nSection 73(2): If parties reach final settlement, they sign the settlement agreement. Parties can request conciliator's assistance in signing.\n\nSection 73(3): The settlement agreement shall be final and binding on the parties.\n\nSection 73(4): The conciliator must authenticate the settlement agreement and provide copies to each party.[^2_3][^2_1][^2_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nOnce you and the borrower sign the settlement agreement under Section 73, it's final and binding. You can directly execute it like a court decree under Section 74 (below). If borrower later claims \"The terms were unfair\" or \"I didn't agree to this,\" the signed settlement under Section 73 is conclusive proof. Ensure you review and approve the final settlement before signing.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\n**Critical Warning:** Once you sign the Section 73 settlement agreement, it's binding and enforceable. You cannot later say \"I changed my mind\" or \"The terms are too harsh.\" The settlement becomes your new loan terms. Before signing, ensure: (i) you completely understand the terms, (ii) you can realistically afford the new payment schedule, (iii) all your counterclaims or disputes are resolved within this settlement, (iv) conciliator has authenticated it.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nIn conciliation between FlexiFinance and borrower Sonia, the conciliator under Section 73(1) formulates: \"Sonia pays ₹10 lakhs within 30 days and restructures remaining ₹8 lakhs into 24 monthly installments of ₹35,000 starting after 45 days; FlexiFinance waives ₹2 lakhs penalty and reduces interest from 14% to 10%.\" Conciliator submits to both parties",

FlexiFinance observes: \"We need partial upfront payment to be ₹5 lakhs, not ₹10 lakhs.\" Sonia observes: \"I cannot pay ₹10 lakhs; maximum is ₹7 lakhs.\" Conciliator reformulates under 73(1): \"₹7 lakhs within 60 days, ₹11 lakhs in 36 monthly installments starting day 65, interest reduced to 10%, penalties waived.\" Both parties agree. They sign the settlement agreement under 73(2). Conciliator authenticates under 73(4). The settlement is now final and binding under 73(3) – FlexiFinance cannot demand original ₹18 lakhs terms, and Sonia cannot later refuse ₹36,000/month restructured payments.[^2_11][^2_2]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 74 – Settlement Agreement is a Decree (Enforcement Power)**\n\n**Section Number:** 74\n\n**Simple Title:** Status and Effect of Settlement Agreement – Execution as Court Decree\n\n**What it means:**\nThe settlement agreement made under Section 73 shall be treated as an arbitral award on agreed terms under Section 30 of this Act. It has the same status, effect, and enforceability as a court decree or arbitral award. It can be executed directly without filing a fresh suit.[^2_2][^2_3]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nIf the borrower defaults on the restructured payment plan (e.g., misses EMI under settlement), you don't file a fresh suit. You directly approach the executing court with the authenticated settlement agreement and file execution application. The court will treat it as a decree and attach borrower's property, bank accounts, salary, etc. This makes settlement agreements highly valuable – they're immediately enforceable.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nThe settlement agreement is a double-edged sword. While it protects you (lender cannot demand more than what's in settlement), it's also immediately enforceable against you. If you default even by one day on the restructured payment schedule in the settlement, the lender can execute it against your property. Ensure you commit only to what you can realistically afford.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nThrough Section 73, SmartsLoan and borrower Rahul sign settlement: \"Rahul pays ₹1 lakh on 1st January 2025, then ₹40,000 on 1st of each month for 24 months; SmartsLoan waives all penalties and reduces interest.\" The conciliator authenticates this under Section 73(4). This authenticated settlement becomes enforceable under Section 74 as a decree. Rahul pays January to June (6 months) on time. On 1st July, he defaults (₹40,000 not paid). Under Section 74, SmartsLoan directly approaches the District Court with the settlement agreement (no new suit filed) and files execution application seeking attachment of Rahul's property and bank account. The court treats the settlement like a court judgment and proceeds with execution. Unlike if Rahul had simply borrowed ₹15 lakhs and defaulted (requiring a new lawsuit), here the settlement agreement itself is the decree.[^2_12][^2_2]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 75 – Confidentiality of Conciliation (What Stays Private)**\n\n**Section Number:** 75\n\n**Simple Title:** Confidentiality of Conciliation Proceedings and Settlement Agreements\n\n**What it means:**\nSection 75(1): Conciliation proceedings and settlement agreements are confidential. No disclosure is allowed except where necessary for: (i) implementing or enforcing the settlement agreement, or (ii) disclosure required by law.\n\nSection 75(2): Parties and conciliator must keep confidential all matters relating to conciliation – this includes statements, proposals, offers, admissions, etc.\n\nSection 75(3): The confidentiality obligation survives termination of conciliation and settlement of dispute.[^2_3][^2_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nYour settlement discussions and proposals are confidential. Your admission during conciliation (\"We can waive ₹2 lakh penalty\") cannot be disclosed publicly or used against you in other cases/disputes. However, once settlement is reached and needs enforcement, the settlement agreement itself becomes public (e.g., when executing it in court).\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nYour financial admissions during conciliation (\"My actual income is ₹8 lakhs,\" \"I took loan from parents,\" \"My business is failing\") are confidential and cannot be used against you in later arbitration/court proceedings. This confidentiality encourages frank discussions during conciliation without fear of information being weaponized later. Even after conciliation ends, parties must maintain confidentiality.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nDuring conciliation between UrbanBank and borrower Meena, Meena admits: \"My business failed; I invested all savings and borrowed from relatives; I cannot pay more than ₹5 lakhs.\" This would be devastating if revealed in arbitration – it admits Meena's finances are in dire straits. Under Section 75, this admission is confidential. If conciliation fails and the matter goes to arbitration, UrbanBank cannot say to the arbitrator: \"In conciliation, Meena admitted her business failed and she has no funds.\" Section 75 prevents this. Meena can freely admit true financial position during conciliation knowing it won't be used against her if settlement isn't reached. This confidentiality",

This confidentiality creates \"safe space\" for honest discussions.[^2_13][^2_2]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 76 – When Does Conciliation End? (Termination Scenarios)**\n\n**Section Number:** 76\n\n**Simple Title:** Termination of Conciliation Proceedings – Four Ways to End\n\n**What it means:**\nConciliation proceedings terminate in the following cases:\n\n(a) By signing of the settlement agreement by the parties (on date of agreement);\n\n(b) By written declaration of the conciliator (after consulting parties) that further efforts at conciliation are no longer justified (on date of declaration);\n\n(c) By written declaration of the parties addressed to the conciliator that conciliation is terminated (on date of declaration);\n\n(d) By written declaration of the conciliator upon default in deposit of costs (if parties don't pay deposits within 30 days) – conciliator may suspend or terminate.[^2_2][^2_3]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nIf you feel conciliation isn't progressing and you want to move to arbitration, you can jointly request (with borrower) termination under 76(c), or if you and borrower cannot agree, wait for the conciliator to declare further efforts unjustified under 76(b). You can also terminate by defaulting on cost deposits (under 76(d)), though this is aggressive and risks being seen as bad faith.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nIf conciliation becomes frustrating (lender is unreasonable or your financial position is truly irreconcilable with lender's demands), you can jointly request termination under 76(c) or wait for conciliator to declare it hopeless under 76(b). If you cannot afford the cost deposits, failure to pay under 76(d) terminates conciliation. However, this may be seen as bad faith termination.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nCase 1 – Successful Settlement [76(a)]: MicroBank and borrower Geeta successfully settle on terms \"₹8 lakhs over 30 months.\" They sign settlement agreement on 15th March. Conciliation terminates on 15th March under 76(a).\n\nCase 2 – Impasse [76(b)]: CapitalCorp and borrower Vikram have been in conciliation for 3 months. CapitalCorp demands ₹18 lakhs total; Vikram can pay maximum ₹10 lakhs. The gap is unbridgeable. After 5 meetings with no progress, the conciliator declares under 76(b) on 30th June: \"Further efforts at conciliation are no longer justified.\" Conciliation terminates. Both parties can now proceed to arbitration.\n\nCase 3 – Joint Termination [76(c)]: PrimeFinance and borrower Anil realize conciliation isn't helping and both want to proceed to arbitration (their agreement allows either party to choose). On 10th May, both jointly request termination. Conciliation terminates on 10th May under 76(c).\n\nCase 4 – Cost Default [76(d)]: ConsumerLoan requires parties to deposit ₹1 lakh each for conciliator's costs. Borrower Rishi fails to deposit within 30 days. Conciliator warns, then declares termination on 25th July under 76(d) for cost default.[^2_9][^2_2]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 77 – No Parallel Court/Arbitration During Conciliation (Stay of Other Proceedings)**\n\n**Section Number:** 77\n\n**Simple Title:** No Concurrent Arbitration or Court Proceedings During Conciliation\n\n**What it means:**\nSection 77(a): During conciliation proceedings, parties shall not initiate arbitration or judicial proceedings on the same dispute, except to preserve rights urgently (e.g., to prevent asset dissipation).\n\nSection 77(b): Parties shall not continue any arbitration or judicial proceedings already initiated, except to preserve rights.[^2_3][^2_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nIf you've invited borrower to conciliation, don't simultaneously file arbitration or lawsuit – this shows bad faith. However, if you fear the borrower will hide assets, you can urgently file Section 9 application in court to freeze assets while conciliation is ongoing. Once conciliation concludes (successfully or not), you can pursue arbitration/lawsuit.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nSimilarly, don't initiate parallel court cases while conciliation is ongoing – this dilutes focus and suggests lack of faith in conciliation. However, if the lender is harassing you (threatening illegal repossession), you can urgently approach court for protection. Section 77 allows emergency steps to preserve rights while generally keeping conciliation exclusive.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nEliteFinance invites borrower Sanjana to conciliation on 1st March. On 3rd March, EliteFinance (fearing Sanjana will sell her vehicle which is loan security) files Section 9 application in court seeking injunction against Sanjana selling/transferring the vehicle. Under Section 77(a), this urgent step to preserve rights is allowed despite conciliation being ongoing. However, EliteFinance cannot simultaneously initiate full arbitration proceedings on 3rd March – that would violate Section 77. EliteFinance must pursue conciliation genuinely. If conciliation succeeds by 1st May (settlement signed), the court's injunction lapses and the settlement terms govern. If conciliation fails by 15th May (conciliator declares no further efforts justified), only",

(Cost Allocation)**\n\n**Section Number:** 78\n\n**Simple Title:** Costs of Conciliation – Conciliator Fees and Expenses\n\n**What it means:**\nSection 78(1): The conciliator fixes the fees and expenses (conciliator's compensation, administrative costs, witness expenses if with parties' consent, expert advice with consent, assistance provided under Sections 64 and 68).\n\nSection 78(2): Unless the settlement agreement provides otherwise, costs are borne by the parties in equal parts.[^2_3][^2_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nConciliation costs are typically split equally – each party pays 50% of conciliator's fees and administrative expenses. However, in the settlement agreement, you can negotiate cost allocation. For instance, \"Borrower pays 60% of costs since lender is recovering the debt.\" Ensure you budget for these costs in your dispute resolution strategy.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nYou'll pay 50% of conciliation costs (conciliator's fees typically ₹5,000-₹50,000 depending on dispute amount, plus institutional fees if any). However, this is often much cheaper than arbitration (arbitrators charge 1-2% of claim amount) or litigation. If you settle through conciliation, the lower costs make it worthwhile. If settlement includes cost-sharing adjustment (e.g., \"Lender bears 70% of conciliator costs\"), that's a plus point.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nDuring conciliation between FinTech and borrower Pradeep over ₹15 lakh, the conciliator fixes fees: Conciliator's compensation: ₹25,000; Institutional support (IIAM): ₹15,000; Total: ₹40,000. Under Section 78(2), each party bears 50% = ₹20,000 each. However, in the settlement agreement, they agree: \"Borrower pays only 30% of costs (₹12,000) as they're financially stressed; FinTech pays 70% (₹28,000).\" This cost-sharing flexibility under Section 78 provides relief to distressed borrowers.[^2_2]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 79 – Demanding Cost Deposits (Ensuring Payment of Fees)**\n\n**Section Number:** 79\n\n**Simple Title:** Deposits for Conciliation Costs – Requiring Upfront Security\n\n**What it means:**\nSection 79(1): The conciliator may require each party to deposit an amount as estimated costs for conciliation.\n\nSection 79(2): During conciliation, if further deposits are needed, conciliator may direct supplementary deposits in equal amounts from each party.\n\nSection 79(3): If required deposits are not paid in full by both parties within 30 days, conciliator may suspend proceedings or declare termination of conciliation.[^2_3][^2_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nIf a borrower is financially weak (obvious from their situation), the conciliator might require ₹50,000 upfront from each party to cover estimated costs. You pay your share promptly to keep conciliation going. If the borrower cannot afford the deposit and defaults, conciliation terminates – you can then proceed to arbitration.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nYou might be asked to deposit ₹50,000 (your share of estimated conciliator's fees). If you cannot afford this upfront deposit, you're in a difficult position – default leads to termination under Section 79(3). Try negotiating: \"Can I pay the deposit in installments?\" or \"Can the settlement agreement provide that my 50% cost deposit be adjusted from the final settlement amount?\" If you cannot pay, conciliation ends and you face arbitration/litigation (which will cost more anyway).\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nDuring conciliation between CapitalOne and borrower Sushma, the conciliator estimates total costs: ₹60,000. Conciliator requests each party to deposit ₹30,000 within 30 days under Section 79(1). CapitalOne deposits promptly. Sushma, claiming financial hardship, cannot deposit. Conciliator warns under Section 79(3) – if deposit isn't paid within 30 days, conciliation will be suspended. By day 25, Sushma arranges funds and deposits ₹30,000. Conciliation continues. Later, during conciliation, additional hearings are needed; conciliator directs supplementary deposit of ₹10,000 each party under Section 79(2). This ensures both parties remain financially committed to the process.[^2_2]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 80 – The Conciliator Cannot Switch Roles (Conflict of Interest)**\n\n**Section Number:** 80\n\n**Simple Title:** Role of Conciliator in Other Proceedings – Cannot Act in Dual Capacity\n\n**What it means:**\nSection 80(1): A conciliator cannot act as arbitrator, lawyer, or witness in any other proceedings relating to the same dispute, unless parties agree otherwise.\n\nSection 80(2): Once conciliation is over, the conciliator's role ends – they step aside from any further proceedings.[^2_3][^2_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nIf",

    "content": "Conciliator in Other Proceedings – Cannot Act in Dual Capacity\n\n**What it means:**\nSection 80(1): A conciliator cannot act as arbitrator, lawyer, or witness in any other proceedings relating to the same dispute, unless parties agree otherwise.\n\nSection 80(2): Once conciliation is over, the conciliator's role ends – they step aside from any further proceedings.[^2_3][^2_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nIf conciliation fails, the conciliator cannot later act as arbitrator in the arbitration proceedings on the same dispute (unless you specifically agree). This maintains the neutrality of conciliation – the conciliator doesn't carry knowledge or bias from conciliation into arbitration. Similarly, if you later sue the borrower in court, the conciliator cannot testify as a witness about what borrower said in conciliation.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nThe conciliator stepping away from subsequent proceedings protects you (Section 75 confidentiality is reinforced). The conciliator won't act as arbitrator and make decisions based on their insights from conciliation discussions. Each process (conciliation, arbitration, litigation) remains separate and independent.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nConciliation between ModernBank and borrower Raju fails. The conciliator, during conciliation, gathered extensive information about Raju's financial position, business challenges, and borrowing needs. Under Section 80(1), when parties move to arbitration, the same conciliator cannot act as arbitrator – they must step aside. A fresh arbitrator is appointed, not knowing details from conciliation. In arbitration, if Raju testifies, the previous conciliator cannot be called as witness to say \"In conciliation, Raju admitted X.\" Section 80 ensures conciliation remains a protected space separate from the adversarial arbitration process.[^2_2]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 81 – Conciliation Discussions Cannot Be Used in Court/Arbitration (Protected Communications)**\n\n**Section Number:** 81\n\n**Simple Title:** Admissibility of Evidence – Conciliation Statements Inadmissible in Later Proceedings\n\n**What it means:**\nSection 81(1): No evidence of statements, admissions, documents prepared for conciliation, or anything said during conciliation proceedings is admissible in arbitration, court proceedings, or other proceedings on the same dispute.\n\nSection 81(2): This applies except where: (a) parties agree otherwise, (b) disclosure is required by law (e.g., court order for justice purposes), or (c) statements already exist independently.[^2_3][^2_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nYou cannot use borrower's statements from conciliation in later arbitration. If borrower said in conciliation \"I can pay ₹5 lakhs,\" you cannot cite this in arbitration to argue the borrower had capacity to pay ₹10 lakhs. Conciliation admissions are protected. Similarly, borrower cannot use your conciliation statements (\"We can waive ₹2 lakh penalty\") as evidence of waiver in arbitration. Each process starts fresh.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\n**Critical Protection:** Anything you say in conciliation is confidential and inadmissible in later proceedings. If you admit your business is failing or your savings are depleted, the lender cannot use these statements in arbitration to argue you're dishonest or hidden assets. This protection under Section 81 encourages frank discussion during conciliation – you can negotiate freely without fear of statements being weaponized.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nDuring conciliation between BikeFinance and borrower Arjun, Arjun (in separate meeting with conciliator) admits: \"I spent part of the loan on personal expenses instead of business investment as promised.\" Conciliation fails. In subsequent arbitration, BikeFinance tries to introduce evidence: \"Borrower admitted in conciliation that they misused the loan.\" Arbitrator invokes Section 81 and rules the conciliation admission inadmissible. BikeFinance must prove loan misuse through independent evidence (not from conciliation statements). Section 81 prevents conciliation from becoming a confession booth where every word can be used against the party.[^2_2]\n\n***\n\n## **PART IV – SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISIONS**\n\n### **Section 82 – High Courts Can Make Rules (Procedure Standardization)**\n\n**Section Number:** 82\n\n**Simple Title:** Power of High Court to Make Rules for Arbitration Proceedings\n\n**What it means:**\nHigh Courts (and Chief Justices) may make rules to regulate proceedings before courts under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act – particularly for Sections 8 (reference to arbitration), 9 (interim relief), 11 (arbitrator appointment), 34 (setting aside awards), and other court-related provisions.[^2_14][^2_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nDifferent High Courts have framed different rules. Delhi High Court has one set of rules, Bombay High Court has another. When filing Section 8 or Section 34 applications, check the specific High Court's rules for: format of applications, required documents, fees, court procedure, designated benches, timelines. Non-compliance with High Court rules can lead to dismissal.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nWhen challenging an arbitral award under Section 34, you must follow that specific High Court's rules. For example, Delhi High Court might require: (i) specific format of application, (ii) mandatory mediation before Section 34 hearing in some cases, (iii) filing affidavit with specific details. Ensure your lawyer knows the local High Court's rules.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nArbitration Award decided in favor of LendRight against borrower Neha for ₹18 lakhs. Neha wants to challenge under Section 34. She hires lawyer in Delhi. Delhi High Court has framed \"Delhi High Court Arbitration Rules, 2018\" under Section 82. These rules require: (i",

Neha wants to challenge under Section 34. She hires lawyer in Delhi. Delhi High Court has framed \"Delhi High Court Arbitration Rules, 2018\" under Section 82. These rules require: (i) Section 34 application in specific format, (ii) detailed affidavit explaining grounds, (iii) certified copy of entire arbitration record, (iv) supporting documents. Neha's lawyer follows these rules precisely. If a lawyer in Delhi files Section 34 application ignoring these court-specific rules (e.g., missing grounds of challenge in affidavit), the application can be rejected for non-compliance with Section 82 rules.[^2_14][^2_2]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 83 – Government Can Remove Implementation Difficulties (Administrative Flexibility)**\n\n**Section Number:** 83\n\n**Simple Title:** Central Government's Power to Remove Difficulties in Implementation\n\n**What it means:**\nIf any difficulty arises in giving effect to the provisions of this Act, the Central Government may issue orders to remove such difficulty. However: (i) this power exists only for 2 years from the Act's commencement (now expired – 1996 Act commencement was 1996, so this power expired in 1998), (ii) government orders cannot be inconsistent with the Act, (iii) all government orders must be published in the Official Gazette.[^2_14][^2_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nThis section is now mostly historical (power expired in 1998). However, government can issue orders to clarify ambiguities. For instance, if there's confusion whether arbitration started under old law continues under new amendments, government can clarify via Section 83 order. Monitor government gazette notifications related to arbitration.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nGovernment orders under Section 83 (if any) provide authoritative interpretation of the Act and clarify grey areas. These orders have legal force and courts follow them. Keep updated on any government orders clarifying arbitration procedures.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nIn 1998, when the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 faced implementation confusion (e.g., whether Section 29A's 12-month timeline applied to arbitrations started before this provision), the Government could have issued an order under Section 83(2) clarifying this. However, since the power expired by 1998, no such order was issued. Later, when the 2015 Amendment Act added Section 29A, the government didn't use Section 83 (power expired) but instead amended the Act directly via Section 87, clarifying applicability to future arbitrations.[^2_2]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 84 – Government Can Make Detailed Rules (Regulatory Framework)**\n\n**Section Number:** 84\n\n**Simple Title:** Power of Central Government to Make Rules – Detailed Procedures and Standards\n\n**What it means:**\nThe Central Government may make rules to carry out the provisions of the Act, including rules regarding: (i) institutional arbitration, (ii) arbitrator accreditation and qualification, (iii) arbitration procedures, (iv) arbitration institutions' grading, (v) fee structures, etc. All rules must be laid before Parliament.[^2_14][^2_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nGovernment rules (framed under Section 84) determine: arbitrator qualifications (minimum education, experience), fee caps (Fourth Schedule rates), accreditation of arbitration institutions, disclosure requirements, standards for conducting proceedings. These rules standardize arbitration practice. When selecting an arbitrator or institution, ensure they comply with government rules.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nGovernment rules protect you by: requiring arbitrators to have certain qualifications, capping their fees, requiring institutional accreditation, ensuring transparency. If an arbitrator is not qualified per government rules or charges fees exceeding Fourth Schedule, you can challenge such fees.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nUnder Section 84, the Ministry of Law and Justice framed \"Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Rules, 2022.\" These rules specify: (i) Arbitrators must have at least 10 years of legal/professional experience, (ii) Arbitrators on the high court's panel must have specialized training, (iii) Arbitration institutions must be government-graded A/B/C categories, (iv) Arbitrator fees for claims ₹20-50 lakhs shall not exceed ₹2.5 lakhs. When FinTech NBFC and borrower Vishal agree to arbitration, they ensure: selected arbitrator has 10+ years experience, selected institution is government-graded, and agreed fees comply with Fourth Schedule (per Section 84 rules).[^2_2]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 85 – Old Arbitration Laws Repealed (Transitional Provision)**\n\n**Section Number:** 85\n\n**Simple Title:** Repeal of Pre-1996 Arbitration Laws – Clean Slate\n\n**What it means:**\nSection 85(1): Three old laws are repealed: (a) Arbitration Act, 1940, (b) Arbitration (Protocol and Convention) Act, 1937, (c) Foreign Awards (Recognition and Enforcement) Act, 1961.\n\nSection 85(2): Notwithstanding repeal, proceedings commenced under those old laws before the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 came into force (22nd August, 1996) shall continue under old laws.[^2_14][^2_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nThis is transitional. If you have arbitrations still pending that started under the 1940 Act",

If you have arbitrations still pending that started under the 1940 Act (before 1996), they continue under 1940 Act rules. But practically, all arbitrations starting after 1996 are under the 1996 Act. Update your arbitration clauses to explicitly cite \"Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.\"\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nOld arbitrations (pre-1996) follow old law rules. New arbitrations (post-1996) follow 1996 Act. The 1996 Act provides better protections (more neutral arbitrator selection, clearer procedures, stronger public policy grounds for setting aside awards). If somehow an old arbitration is still pending, you're stuck with old law – less protective.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nHeritageCorp's 1994 loan agreement with borrower MrOldBusiness contained arbitration clause referring to \"Arbitration Act, 1940.\" Arbitration was initiated in 1995 but remained pending due to procedural delays. After August 22, 1996, the 1940 Act was repealed by Section 85. However, under Section 85(2), this pending 1995 arbitration continues under 1940 Act rules (not switched to 1996 Act rules). MrOldBusiness is stuck with older, less protective procedures. If the arbitration were started in 1997, it would be under 1996 Act with better protections.[^2_2]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 86 – Saving for Old Foreign Awards (Ancient Awards Still Enforceable)**\n\n**Section Number:** 86\n\n**Simple Title:** Saving Provision for Pre-1996 Foreign Awards under Geneva Convention\n\n**What it means:**\nSection 86: Although the Foreign Awards (Recognition and Enforcement) Act, 1961 is repealed by Section 85, any foreign arbitral award made before August 22, 1996 (under the Geneva Convention, 1927) can still be enforced under the saved provisions of the 1961 Act.[^2_14][^2_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nVery old foreign awards (before 1996) under Geneva Convention can still be enforced using the old 1961 Act framework. However, practically, most pre-1996 foreign awards are now time-barred or unenforceable due to laches (delay). This section preserves their enforceability in principle.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nIf there's an ancient foreign arbitral award against you (pre-1996, Geneva Convention-based), the creditor can still attempt enforcement under the saved 1961 Act provisions. However, you might have defenses: limitation period, change of circumstances, impossibility of performance, etc.\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nIn 1991, a French court made an arbitral award against Indian importer VintageGoods under Geneva Convention. The French creditor never enforced it. In 2024, the French creditor discovers VintageGoods is doing better financially and tries enforcement. Under Section 86, the 1961 Act's provisions are saved – the creditor can attempt enforcement using old 1961 Act procedures (which are now quite dated). However, VintageGoods argues: (a) 33-year limitation period should apply, (b) award is time-barred, (c) VintageGoods' circumstances have changed. Courts might reject the enforcement on these grounds despite Section 86's saving.[^2_2]\n\n***\n\n### **Section 87 – The Critical Transition Rule (When Do Amendments Apply?)**\n\n**Section Number:** 87\n\n**Simple Title:** Effect of 2015 and 2019 Amendments – Applicability to Pending Arbitrations\n\n**What it means:**\nSection 87 (added by 2015 Amendment Act and further amended in 2019):\n\n(1) The amendments made by the 2015 Amendment Act (which added Sections 29A, 29B, and strengthened arbitrator independence rules) apply to arbitral proceedings commenced on or after October 23, 2015.\n\n(2) Court proceedings arising from such arbitrations also follow the amended Act.\n\n(3) Arbitrations commenced before October 23, 2015 continue under the pre-2015 law (unless parties expressly agree to apply new provisions).\n\n(4) The 2019 Amendment (further clarifying public policy) applies similarly.[^2_14][^2_2]\n\n**Effect for Money-Lending Company:**\nCheck when the arbitration commenced. If before October 23, 2015: old law applies (no mandatory 12-month deadline under Section 29A, more lenient arbitrator rules, older cost regime). If on or after October 23, 2015: new law applies (12-month deadline with 6-month extension possible, stricter arbitrator independence, clearer fee structures). This significantly impacts your arbitration strategy – timelines differ.\n\n**Effect for Customer/Borrower:**\nIf arbitration started before October 23, 2015, old rules apply – potentially more favorable to borrowers (less time pressure on arbitrator, less strict arbitrator independence rules, but also less protection). If on or after October 23, 2015, new rules apply – stronger protections (strict arbitrator independence, mandatory timelines, reduced arbitrator fees for delays).\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nFastLoan Finance initiated arbitration against borrower Ramesh on September 1, 2015 (before October 23,",

If on or after October 23, 2015, new rules apply – stronger protections (strict arbitrator independence, mandatory timelines, reduced arbitrator fees for delays).\n\n**Practical Scenario:**\nFastLoan Finance initiated arbitration against borrower Ramesh on September 1, 2015 (before October 23, 2015 cutoff). The arbitration continues under pre-2015 law. Section 29A's 12-month deadline doesn't apply – arbitration can drag on. On October 24, 2015, FastLoan initiates separate arbitration against borrower Neha. Neha's arbitration is governed by post-2015 law – must conclude within 12 months (extendable to 18 months). This creates two different timelines for similar disputes.\n\nLater, the 2019 Amendment clarifies public policy grounds for setting aside awards. For Ramesh's pre-2015 arbitration, even after 2019, the old public policy definition applies. For Neha's post-2015 arbitration, the 2019-amended public policy applies. Section 87 ensures old arbitrations aren't disrupted by new amendments but also means they're not modernized.[^2_2]\n\n***\n\n## **CONCLUSION**\n\nThe Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 provides a comprehensive framework for resolving disputes outside traditional courts. For money-lending companies and borrowers, key takeaways are:\n\n**For Lenders:**\n\n- Draft clear, neutral arbitration clauses (avoid unilateral arbitrator appointment)\n- Specify seat of arbitration and consider fast-track for smaller claims\n- Maintain proper documentation for efficient arbitration\n- Consider conciliation for relationship preservation\n- Act within limitation periods and comply with timelines\n\n**For Borrowers:**\n\n- Read and understand arbitration clauses before signing\n- Participate actively in arbitration – don't ignore notices\n- Challenge biased arbitrators early (Section 12-13)\n- Preserve rights to challenge awards (Section 34 – only 3 months!)\n- Consider conciliation for negotiated settlements\n\nBoth parties benefit from arbitration's speed and privacy compared to court litigation, provided the process is fair, neutral, and conducted in good faith.[^1_60][^1_61][^1_3][^1_5][^1_4][^1_7][^1_8][^1_1][^1_2]\n\n***\n\n*This guide is based on the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 as amended up to 2019, along with judicial interpretations and practical applications in financial disputes.*\n<span style=\"display:none\">[^1_62][^1_63][^1_64][^1_65][^1_66][^1_67][^1_68][^1_69][^1_70][^1_71]</span>\n\n<div align=\"center\">⁂</div>\n\n[^1_1]: https://www.indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/11799/1/the_arbitration_and_conciliation_act,_1996.pdf\n\n[^1_2]: https://www.indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/21922/1/the_arbitration_and_conciliation_act,_1996_act_no._26_of_1996.pdf\n\n[^1_3]: https://courtbook.in/search/act/the-arbitration-and-conciliation-act-1996-664c7c7bad9dd371756ec998\n\n[^1_4]: https://thelegalschool.in/blog/important-sections-of-arbitration-act\n\n[^1_5]: https://blog.ipleaders.in/arbitration-and-conciliation-act-1996/\n\n[^1_6]: https://www.ebcwebstore.com/product/arbitration-and-conciliation-act-1996-bare-act?products_id=382\n\n[^1_7]: https://lawrato.com/banking-finance-legal-advice/received-a-notice-from-arbitrator-109679\n\n[^1_8]: https://www.legals365.com/legal-advice/legal-advice-for-personal-loan-recovery-in-nbfcs\n\n[^1_9]: https://www.dghindia.gov.in/assets/downloads/l1.pdf\n\n[^1_10]: https://legalaffairs.gov.in/actsrulespolicies/arbitration-and-conciliation-act-1996\n\n[^1_11]: https://economictimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/bank-loans-how-will-the-court-ruling-on-arbitrator-affect-you/articleshow/21052684.cms\n\n[^1_12]: https://www.scconline.com/blog/post/2023/05/12/appointment-of-arbitrator-in-lender-borrower-agreements/\n\n[^1_13]: https://lawbhoomi.com/arbitration-and-conciliation-act-notes-case-laws-and-reading-materials/\n\n[^1_14]: https://indiacode.nic.in/handle/123456789/1978?view_type=browse\n\n[^1_15]: https://www.taxmann.com/bookstore/product/40008283-arbitration-conciliation-act-regulations-bare-act-section-notes\n\n[^1_16]: https://mandjservice.com/products/arbitration-and-conciliation-act-1996-bare-act-2025-air-nagpur\n\n[^1_17]: https://www.toprankers.com/arbitration-and-conciliation-act-notes-for-judiciary\n\n[^1_18]: https://www.argus-p.com/papers-publications/thought-paper/binding-non-signatories-to-arbitration-tracing-the-evolution-of",
